      <p>
A <em>facebook</em> friend named Ron Greenough died a few days ago. I don’t know the causes of his demise, but I spent a minute on his timeline and found he posted something (I forget what now) on the 21st. Ron and I never met. Actually, during the last few years, we never exchanged any personal quips.</p>
<p>
I believe I <em>got to know him</em> in 2009, soon after my mandatory exile from the Czech Republic. He was some relation of Justin or other. I’m not sure which. I never bothered to find out since it was utterly unimportant to me. I only vaguely recall that we shared some similar spiritual and humouristic views. This, too, was not very important.</p>
<p>
He has perished and people are writing on his timeline asking him to <em>rest in peace</em> as if his corpse could somehow absorb the electricity that distributes these messages. I’ll state the obvious and declare that <em>death</em> is a <em>function</em> that has two arguments, or inputs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
The deceased (or, to be accurate, the <em>fixin’to be deceased</em>)  </li>
  <li>
A <em>vector</em> or <em>array</em> of people that know the <em>fixin to be deceased</em>  </li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="clojure">(defn death [human humans]
  (map (fn [h]
         (affect human h))
       humans))</code></pre>
<p>
The <em>non-deceased</em> humans are run through the blender that I give the function name <em>affect</em>. This function filters parts of the <em>fixin to be deceased</em> according to each <em>non-deceased</em> and modifies the latter with them.</p>
<p>
Ron’s death affected me enough to spawn this entry in the <em>Martenblog</em>. I guess, in my life, this impetus was Ron’s purpose. To each <em>non-deceased</em>, a differing impetus. </p>
<p>
The subject of celebrities dying this year seems a big deal on social media. Take Prince, for example. <em>Non-deceased</em> humans are raving about him! <em>Fixin to be deceased</em> ones possibly not so much. Prince’s impetus has been to forcibly take control of the minds of multitudes and make them gather into mobbish clusters and celebrate. I did not know Prince personally, but I feel he’d probably have approved. I did not mingle with any mobbish mass, but I did listen to three of his albums the other day.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Purple Rain  </li>
  <li>
Around the World in a Day  </li>
  <li>
1999  </li>
</ul>
<p>
I enjoyed my time with these albums and attempted to actively listen as much as possible. Slaving away over the terminal for the sake of patching up a few bugs for James’s peace of mind interfered with my concentration at times, as usual. <em>Purple Rain</em> is very enjoyable. The second album, less so. <em>1999</em> could expunge its own second half and I’d not blink my singular, ogling eye.</p>
<p>
Needless to say, I did not tear up for either of these two corpses. Other corpses will probably have the impetus to create a flow of tears from my singular, ogling eye. We’ll see. I may or may not let <em>Martenblog</em> know.</p>
<p>
Fuck um.</p>
