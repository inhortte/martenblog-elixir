I miss you.  I speak the very first thing that comes to my mind.  I
miss you.  You didn't call today.  I assume the Belgian telephone
service just sucks to all hell.  God, I love you.  Do these words
carry the emotion I feel deep inside of my bosom?  I hope so.  Because
I wish to be at your side.  All the rest of life is bullshit.  I love
you, Brynn.  My tattoo bounces as I type this diatribe.  My eyes glaze
from the fatigue I feel.  My arms ache from endless situps and
pushups... they want to hold you, rest in a passion that is
unnamable.  <strong><em>GOD</em></strong>, I love you.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
Sometimes I wonder if this is only a dream and I am hoping for some
fantasy my mind has conjured.  Sometimes I can touch your skin in my
head, run my lithe fingers along the flesh of your arms, your
shoulders, down along your chest, 'round your breasts, to your
stomache.  This night is horrific.  I miss you.  I repeat myself
diligently.  I suppose there is no other way, except, of course, your
actually being with me to feel my emotion.  Otherwise, I am a rock, an
island reaching its isthmuses out to sea in search of your harbour.
Oh, god, Brynn, don't you know how much I love you?  Sometimes I am so
afraid and sometimes I am so confident.  My side is cold and lonely,
wishing for your warmth to heal its solitude.  I am a melodramatic
fool.  I love you... I repeat myself again.  Perhaps I should go to
sleep.  Call me, my love... I miss you.</font></p>
