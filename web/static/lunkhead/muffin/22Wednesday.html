Madly missing you, my love, I am.

Before, there was on oaken door with only a small eyehole from which I
could gaze.  You arrived and unlocked it, drawing me, a scared and
lonely child, from my oppressive room.  I love you, Brynn.

I have just finished listening to the first compilation created for
me by you whilst I pined for you in Juneau.  Now I listen to 'The Lamb
Lies Down on Broadway', specifically 'In the Cage'.  I am filled with
thoughts of our past, our present and our future.  It is delectable,
though wrenching.  I wish I were lying at your side in Amsterdam,
listening to the darkness breathe with your pulsing breath, dimly, by
the light of the moon, resting my eyes on your tranquil face.  I love
you <em>immensely</em>.  My calculator states that it is 13 days, 2
hours, 27 minutes and 50 seconds until I am reunited with you.  I
think brightly of that dazzling day.  I love you.  I repeat myself.
<strong>I LOVE YOU!</strong></font></p>

I replied elaborately to your dad's email concerning energy and going
with the flow and such.  In all actuality, I do agree with much of
what he says, but wouldn't choose the words he used to describe it.  I
then went off onto a tangent of my own, describing my views on time as
a fixture and contrasting it with an equally important view of life as
absurd and building meaning that is permanent, perpetual, and
consistent to <em>battle</em> the futility of life [as opposed to
simply living for an endless string of caprices and in reality just
<strong>ignoring</strong> futility instead of
<strong>fighting</strong> it].  I look foward to his reply.  I'll
include the email as a link on the other page so you can read it if
you want.  I would definately delight in your thoughts on it!<br>

I am scribing for you a postcard in french to fly away to paris.  I
bought it [yes, it is NOT a magic eye <em>thurk</em>!] in sonora,
texas on the way to college station on sunday.  It occurred to me that
it might amuse you, my love.  I do hope you are feverishly tittilated
by it.</font></p>

Ostensibly, I feel very inarticulate.  I feel like I am stumbling
round my phrases, bumbling clumsily with aleatoric adjectives,
tripping over fickle verbs.  Maybe it is just the thought of whales,
Brynn, that unrests my mind so.  I look to the day when we will have
our <strong>OWN</strong> whale and quit having to borrow them every
time my aggrivating little whale [<em>whales, Brynn!</em>] fetish
rears its wizened head.  I want a whale named 'Guenevere', Brynn.
Yes, that would be a swell thing.  But enough about whales, my love.
Tell me about yourself!  What did you have for breakfast today?  Was
it yummy?  Did you sleep well?  Did you dream of whales?
<strong>WHALES</strong>, Brynn!  Oh, there I go again.  I must
desist.  Perhaps if I start a new paragraph, I will calm
myself.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
I have arranged most all of my <em>stuff</em> which I procured from
college station into two categories:
<ul>
<li>The things my parents should send to us when we get a place.
<li>The things my parents can keep for quite a while until I feel the
need for them.
</ul>
There are much more of the latter category... more
<strong>boxes</strong> full, that is.  I have so many cassette tapes
that I am ashamed.  I never threw anything away.  But this time, I
follow your example when you were cleaning out and going through your
possessions, and discard pointless, space-wasting bullshit.  It is
nearly one o'clock.  Oddly, I am tired [whereas I am usually not at
this time of the night ... oh nocturnal boy that I am] but do not wish
to be.  I still want to construct the little thurk which makes my
little lovey word for you change every time you access the page which
takes you to this one.  So, instaed of just 'scintillating cornflake',
it can state that you are also a 'scintillating loveling', a
'scintillating rapture nugget', et-cetera.  When you get on that page,
use your 'refresh' option a few times and do detail your thoughts in a
bit of splendorous email, my love!  My <em>love</em>!  My
<em><strong>love</strong></em>!  My</font>
<font color="#FF0000" size="5"><em><strong>love</strong></em></font>
<font size="5">!  Oooooh.... *growl*  :)  I adore you,
Brynn.</font></p>

I was musing within the thought of you consuming falafel the other day
and became very fond of the thought of having a bit of falafel,
myself.  Of course, there is no establishment in Fort Stockton which
dispenses the yummy chick-pea-type-apparatus, and I was too
<em>DAMN</em> busy with my happy packing thing to cook some.  So, we
must have some falafel when I am again in your presence... okay, love?
<em>love</em>?  <em><strong>love</strong></em>?  
<font color="#FF0000" size="5"><em><strong>love</strong></em></font>
<font size="5">?  By the wayside, I am sending you a list of cyber
cafes in Paris [and also, in fact, in many cities around that
europe-type-apparatus], so you can continue reading my little
meandering soliloquies [if you desire to, my love] whilst in france.

Oh my love!  I have just slaved over a petulant PERL script to create
a variable salutation on the page which leads to this one!  I hope you
are tantalized!  I love you deeply, Brynn.  It is now 2:20 and my
eyelids droop wearily.  Oh, to press my fatigued form to yours and
fall into a gracious slumber!  Soon... so very soon I shall.  My
passion for you resonates.  To you I give my heart which beats each
second to feel the rapture of your love.  I long to be with you, to
touch you, to gaze into your visage.</font></p>
