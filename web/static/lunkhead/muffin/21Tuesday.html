My love, my <em>wondrous</em> love, I sit before this stoic terminal
and type words that cannot possibly carry the beauteous feeling I hold
for you in their essence.  It is 12:45 a.m.  I have spent the last
several hours working on all of the stunning pages which led up to
this one.  I hope you enjoy all of the colours, the pictures and the
music [all of which I wrote], if, as I am assuming, you have a
graphical and aural terminal at yon Amsterdamish cafe.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size=5">
I am drinking Zima.  <em>ZIMA!</em>  Horrific, eh?  Well, dispite the
fact that they taste much like Fresca, the taste transcends that of
the poor selection of beers to be partook of in this sad excuse for a
community.  I sped away in my mother's creaking cadillac to fetch them
about ten-thirty.  I am imbibing my fourth.  The music of 'a fool
fancying cliches' bellows from the speakers connected surreptitiously
to the computer.  It is the music that accompanies the page that will
lead you to these words.  I'll try to change it every few days.
Heh... I feel the alcohol batter my neurons into submission with
fervour!  My synapses, in all of their vacuous wonder, chuckle at
their companions as the li'l molecules of C2OHN5 [I think that is
alcohol] pummel and subdue their comerades.</font></p>

Do you know what is annoying as hell about html?  I have to, before
each paragraph, type this:<br>
<<p align="left"><<font size="5"><br>
Ya know?  I mean... what can a poor boy like me do about this evil
trait of writing maniacally into the computer like a madman smashing
randomly into the keys...?  Actually, I suppose, it is not a bad
thing, because I can change fonts, colours, etc.  Like this [damn, I
hope you have a graphical terminal, or I am going to feel really
fucking stupid]:<br></font>

This should be a splendidly bright red.  Yes, my love.  It SHOULD!
God, I miss you.  That sounds like a non-sequitor, but, in reality
[well, the hazy reality that accompanies the sordid life in Fort
Stockton, Texas, that is], every word I have typed has yeared to turn
towards the keys which would spell out: "<em><strong>I FUCKING MISS
YOU, BRYNN!</strong></em>"  Mmmmm.... Heh.  *smile*  I wish to
sensuously caress your skin right now, run my hand softly, slowly
along your back, down your spine's alluring curve to your pelvis,
tease your thighs with ellipses of passion by my fingers.  Ooooh, I am
turning myself on!  Perhaps it is time to switch fonts!<br></font>
<font color="#0000FF" size="5">
This should be a brilliant blue, my love.  And with that sentiment, I
continue, ringing your loins with my fingers which ache to give to you
a pleasure immersurable.  All the while, my lips traipse along your
naked neck and chest, writing their own novella of ecstacy upon the
supple skin of your breasts, apexing climaxes of ardour upon each of
your nipples.  Grrrrrrr...... *sigh*</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="5">
I am very turned on at this moment, wish I had a means to satiate my
throbbing erection... [boy, i'm being explicit!  i'm sorry....!] but
there is no <em>YOU</em> here, Brynn.  I love you... It is
<strong>only</strong> you for whom I pine.  My languid soliloquy
stammers on into the silence around me.  I hope it reaches you in that
faraway land.  I miss you, my love.  I cry.  The tears spatter.  You
have given me love.  You have given me life.</font></p>

I shuffled and clawed through piles of temporary nostalgia today [and,
actually, i am not finished... I have three boxes to go!].  The only
things worth saving are books and a few poems and writings from the
past.  I picked out forty-eight pictures for you, all of me [oh
<em>vain</em> Bob!], which I shall send to Paris come the dawn, come
the morrow.  Most everything I perused gave me nothing but sadness, a
quaint vacuity which grabbed at my soul, threatening to thrall it into
some hind-sight slavery.  throughout it all, I missed your simper,
your laugh, your solemn words.  Oh, Brynn!  I want to share every bit
of my twisted life with you and never hold back a thing... <strong>I
SHALL NOT EVERY HOLD BACK ANYTHING</strong>.  My tattoo gazes at me as
I type, bouncing happily like a child on a swing.  I miss
you.</font></p>

I am becoming intoxicated.  Unfortunately, you are not here with me.
If you were, I would certainly grasp you and fall fitfully asleep in
your arms.  It is what I wish for axiously.  Home is with
<em>you</em>, my love... with <strong>YOU</strong>.  Melodrama careens
through my brain!  I envision your body pressed next to mine, but,
hapless, I must only yearn.  Quell my fears, my love!  Tomorrow is
filled with splendour and I await it restlessly, with a heart full of
hope.  I want a life with you, my love.  I miss you.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="6">
My night and day dreams are filled with you...<br>
Your fasting [fasting for <strong><em>YOU</em></strong>, Brynn!]
