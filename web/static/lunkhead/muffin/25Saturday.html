I stare at your pictures.<br>
I reach out to touch your skin.<br>
Tears glisten upon my cheeks.<br>

I sit before yet another terminal missing you, my love.  My uncle
doses to my right in front of a blathering television.  I should turn
it off, surely.  Sleep has been scarce.  After speaking with you in
your morning, [and, oh Brynn, your words touched me deeply, filled the
vacuous space within me which pines eternally for you], I fell
blearily into that bed for the last time for quite a while, I am
sure.  One of my last thoughts before blissfully becoming unconscious,
was that the next time i <strong>DO</strong> sleep in that bed, it
will most probably be with you when we visit my happy-go-lucky
family-type-apparatus.  I smile at this thought broadly.</font></p>

My mother told me pointedly that she was going to awaken me
<em>early</em> so I could accompany them to the mall.  I breathed my
chagrin at this notion and went on with my business [which was working
on all the modifications I have appended to this expanding electronic
illustration of my ardent love for you].  I plan to hang out in this
house [which, although very <em>normal</em> as far as surburban houses
go, serves as a temporary new environment: slightly refreshing]
instead and hopefully be in your scintillating presence via the
telephone during a few enderingly awaited moments during my
afternoon.  I love you.  My fatigued body and mind cry to lie sleepily
at your side, holding your warm form to my skin and slowly falling
into a gracious slumber.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
Now, dizzily, I shall retire for the night and harbour tantalizing thoughts
of our life together... a glorious span of time which will begin in
nine days.  Before I do so, however, I am going to re-read your email
once more.  My <strong><em>GOD</em></strong>, you make me feel
wonderful, even from so far away, my wonderfully tasty pineapple of
desire!  I cannot wait to be with you again.  Je t'aime toujours.
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">
I miss you...<br>
Holding you close, sleeping in your arms...<br>
I want that so badly...<br>
I love you, Brynn.<br>
Your fricative fishstick,</br>
-Bob.</font></p>
