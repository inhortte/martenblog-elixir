Oh, my <strong><em>LOVE</em></strong>!  I have stayed up exceedingly
late <strong>AGAIN</strong>, talking to my uncle about music.  I made
him listen to 'Reba' by Phish and suggested that he buy 'Rift'.  I
think he is going to.  Nifty, eh?  We also spoke about movies and I
suggested many for him to watch, such as these:
<ul>
<li>12 Monkeys.
<li>Brazil.
<li>The Fisher King.
<li>Dead Man.
<li>Immortal Beloved.
</ul>
What do you think?  Good suggestions?  Oh, love!  I was so happy to
speak to you this evening!  I am filled with joy!  Tu me donnes la
joie!  *smile*  Strangely, my toes are going numb.  This disturbs me.
My loopy early morning tired thing is prodding my synapses with the
caddle prod of its choice.  Thus the non-sequitor-type-apparati.  On
to the next paragraph.

I have just finished the arrangement of the current portrait gallery.
I desperately hope you are in liking of its contents and order.  It is
amazing how happy it makes me to do things for you, my love.  These
words, those pictures, they are all for <em>you</em>.  *smile*  My
fatigue weighs heavy on my shoulders, yet still I pine for you from
the depths of this surburban home in south-west Fort Worth.  To hold
you in my arms is my wish.  I was pondering nigh an hour ago about the
fact that in one mere week from this moment, we shall most likely be
lying, sleeping, side by side in our bed in a hotel in Paris after our
first night together in two months.  I am tittilated!  Je te veux!
<strong><em>NOW!</em></strong></font></p>

I spoke, as you know, to your parents earlier, and have just recently
received an email from them.  They are very kind to me and I am
greatful.  I smiled [beamed, actually] when I read their words about
you being extremely excited about exploring europe with me.  I love
you so much, Brynn!  And I miss you like hell.  Oh, my love!  I need
to sleep!  <em>God</em>, I wish I could cuddle warmly at your side and
fall into a blissful slumber...  but I shall return to my cold bed now
and dream away the hours instead.

You are ever in my thoughts.<br>
I long for you.<br>
