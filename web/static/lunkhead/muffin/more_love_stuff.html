We are about to traipse away to Fort Worth.  I thought, after your
wonderfully wrenching [wrenching because i <em>miss</em> you, Brynn!]
email graced my eyes, that I could leave you with a small note
detailing my adoration for you.  I dreamed as I slept after our very
poignant talk about the two of us walking down a street in New York
City, holding hands.  You were telling me that our life was the most
perfect thing you could ever imagine.  I remember my sense of
happiness in the dream.  There is this fountain on 52nd street that I
have to take you to one day.  In the dream, we stopped in front of it
and I cried, too filled with emotion to speak.  Then I kissed you and
the dream ended.  I love you so much, Brynn!  So
<strong>MUCH</strong>!

I shall write you a handwritten letter on the way to Fort Worth... it
is a eight hour drive.  I want to say again that I echo what you said
in your email:  I don't want to <em>EVER</em> do anything that will
fuck up our relationship.  I love you.  I want you.  I need you in my
life.  Please knock me upside of the head if I ever do anything
stupid, my love!  I want to kiss you, touch you, hold you, stare into
our eyes.  I love you desperately!  *smile*  I'll talk to you
tomorrow.
