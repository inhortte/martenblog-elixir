<h1>Random Nobodies</h1>

The first complete Alfred 'Album', <em>Random Nobodies</em> was
created in the wake of the dispairing first Alfred gig at the
MexicArte in Austin.  On a rented four track, the four prominent
members threw together twenty tracks of underproduced, quickly
constructed mayhem and otherwise coherent meandering over the course
of three months:  March 1990 through May 1990.  Inexperience in
the field of aural recording is evident.  Amongst the hissingly
prominent high end and oftern pitiful vocal lines is, however, a good
dose of creative energy and band synergy.<p>
The text from the ultimately spiffy fold-out tape cover follows...

<h2>This incarnation of <strong>Sir Alfred IV and the Poison Nectar
Group</strong> is ...
<ul>
<li><em>Lee "The Bitchin' Steve" Tarver</em>, who plays that stringhy
thinghy (the new one; the old one got chunked) and sings
(occasionally, sort of thing).
<li><em>Acy "Flog Me With a Chain" Stapp</em><a href="#footnote_thing">*</a>,
who plays those not-so-stringhy thinghys that you push down and sings
(constantly, but we didn't record any of it, except once when he was
talking).
<li><em>Tony "I Believe the Moon is Made of Green Cheese" Hogard</em>,
who doesn't not play bass (or jump around enough, although his knees
are quite knobby) and vocalizes (leadingly) and sings (that's not him
on Halley's...).
<li><em>Andrea "The World Turns Around Me" Trevino</em>, whose vocal
chords vibrate eloquently (especially when you rub her tummy) and who
sings (though she does it so well you dno't really notice).
<li><em>John "Bop 'til You Drop" Feldmann</em>, who hits a lot of
inanimate objects made out of cows (dead) and sings (but not on this
tape).
<li><em>Bob "That Chemical Used in Pesticides" Shelton</em>, Alfred's
official tusk tickler who also plays keyboards (those not-so-stringhie
thinghies you push down) and sings (we bet you thought that was the
mating call of a yak, didn't you?) with a plumb.
</ul>
<a name="footnote_thing">*</a>Acy really, really likes llamas.  A lot.
