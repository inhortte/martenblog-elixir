<h1>Creations by Sir Alfred IV</h1>
<pre>Radio, Television and Film sucks small grey objects
But no one objects
To the possibilities abstracted
Fundamentally obstructed
Taken
Shaken
Split apart
Atom by atom...

<strong>Loyal Bassett</strong> once said, <em>"I prefer a yak
in my foot for fun?"</em> and <strong>Chris Johnson</strong> mused,
<em>"I predict I will be dead by Wednesday."</em> All the while
<strong>Chris Bender</strong> exclaimed, <em>"You know what
sucks? Working at Target Food Avenue all day with a hangover!
That's what sucks!"</em><p>
