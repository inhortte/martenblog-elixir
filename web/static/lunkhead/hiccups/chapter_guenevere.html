--Carrying on in the previous vein:<br>
I just tangled in conversation with this idea, so I shall write it, no
matter its relative wackiness.  Say knowledge, in a way, is passed
genetically, but not the knowledge itself, but only, as i mentioned on
the last page, the ability to learn <i>types</i> of knowledge.  Use
types in the way a common university uses the word to divide
knowledge:  Chemistry, Physics, English, Photography, etc.  A single
mutation that slightly alters a few atoms gives or takes the
ability (or increases/decreases) to absorb a certain type.  This
mutation happens infrequently, though often enough that when the whole
world is populated from a few individuals, it creates an exceedingly
wide variety of ability to or to not learn.<p>
BUT!  I've always, in the past, believed in the human ability to excel
in almost anything by sheer will (I am speaking of intellectual feats,
of course, not instances of telekinesis or muscle tone).  This has
been from my own point of view, however, and it might just be the cage
that I can intellectually prosper in most all of the subjects I have
endevoured in.... It is impossible to make a testable hypothesis,
though, since I can very improbably tackle each and every subject
matter in the universe during my lifetime.  Unless I tackle the
problem of mortality first, of course.<p>
If a human being's <i>MEANING</i> is not intrinsic, <i>NOT</i> found
<i>ONLY</i> in itself, then, naturally, its meaning is derived from
<i>ITSELF</i> and its <i>lifelong context</i> (no matter how
convoluted).  It would seem (to me, anyhow, and I know that is a
fucking opinion, but I cannot see how else to express at this late
hour), perhaps, that for a "thing" that cannot find meaning within
itself to find meaning, and I am assuming that an encoded part of
every (living) thing is a desire to find its "meaning", it would have
a goal that is (simply) to look for that meaning.  I have many
examples.  I shall only illustrate one.  I could perform this feat in
one word: "religion", which can be generalized out to the word
"philosophy" and further out to "ideology."  Every man has an
ideology.  I believe I can safely make that generalization.  To be
absolutely positive, though, I shall define the word:<p>
<pre>
IDEOLOGY:
  The manner of thinking
            OR
  The content (written or unwritten rules of self-behavior
               and self-modification) of thinking
  that any given individual characterizes.
</pre>
A man or woman develops, seeks out, hybridizes, transforms, rejects,
negates, or accepts an ideology to find meaning for his existence.  If
you want proof of this hypothesis, go visit your local Baptist Student
Union.<br>

Word for the day:<br>

--RECHERCHE:
  exquisite or choice...
  also... overblown or pretentious.

A few thoughts on "meaning".  Inspired by GEB.<br>
There seem to be three levels in the search for meaning in any
particular object:<br>
<ol>
<li>the realization that there is, in fact, meaning there to be found.
<li>the ideas, conceptions, thoughts and notions that allow the actual
decoding of the message inherent to the object.
<li>the actual message.
</ol>
These three "levels" are found in all types of "decypherings"
throughout life, whether one realizes it or not.  Suppose a steel box
violently crashes through the roof of your house and smashes your new
porcelain rutabaga.  You could ignore it.  You could pick it up, toss
it in the nearest dumpster and carry on with your life.  You
<i>COULD</i> examine it a bit.  Suppose you pick this last option.
Picking it up, you hear something "clunk" inside.  This allows you the
first level in meaning mentioned above.  You now recognize there is
something to be sought.  Then you may start contemplating a way to
open the steel box.  Suppose you decide to go down to the local
hardware store, pick up a cutting torch, come home, read its
instruction manual (because you should <i>ALWAYS</i> read the
instructions) and decide this is a correct method of opening the steel
box.  You have now proceeded to the second level of meaning, the level
that allows you to find the "message," or in this case, open the box.
Your new blowtorch is your decoding weapon.  Once you cut the box open
and find a package of Ritz crackers, you have the message that was
inherent to the box.<p>
Because this entire process was attainable by only two things -- the
box and your intellect -- this box's "meaning" is intrinsic within the
box, but only in the context of human interaction...<p>
Now the package of Ritz Crackers is an altogether new "object".  What
if you had never seen a package of Ritz crackers before?  Suppose you
have never even known the concept  of "eat" before, etc... you apply
the same rules.  GEB used the example of a note in a bottle.  The
first level of meaning is surpassed when you realize there is
something other than a bottle containing a white piece of paper with
scribbles.  The second level is realized seeing the note is in a
particular language, telling you the method of decoding.  And,
obviously, the message is the text itself.  It is unique in that no
matter who the decoder might be, and no matter the actual decoding
<i>method</i>, the only actually translatable message will
<i>always</i> be the same.<p>
--And now something that frequently bothers me:<br>
Let us call "music", "movies", "television", "books",
etc.. <i>MEDIA</i>.  I think there is an amazing paucity in my
observation of the "coming to the conclusion" that the first level of
meaning is evident in much of today's media.  Sure, there are possibly
many meaningless (in every respect) instances, such as lyrics to the
modern pop song (not all--some).  Is it an environmental thing?  Is
the cause for this lack of sight the "context" of many people's lives?
 I believe so.  (since it is probably not transmitted
hereditarily!)<p>
So I shall use the song I fiddled with at another point in this
journal, "A fool fancying cliches" ... the lyrics this time.  Perhaps
this song is gaily bouncing out of a nearby amplification system and a
passerby stops to consider it.  She hears the words.  Now, as in
several examples above, she may simply walk away untouched, BUT, in an
unguarded moment of speculation, she suspects something relevant to
the words coursing forth from the speaker.  She has identified that
there is meaning, that is, the first level has been traversed.
Suppose a page containing the words to "fool" is lying near the stereo
spewing the song and, of course, that it catches her eye.  Picking it
up, she may now traipse on to the second level of meaning and attempt
to grasp a decoding method.  Now, the message is held not in the actual
words, but in metaphor and allegory constructed by the words.  Our
eager subject must use her imagination coupled with any imagery the
words inspire.  She can then make connections (find similarities)
between the images conjured and situations experienced/observed in her
lifetime.  She has decoded the message.<p>
--Is there enough meaning and message, image and allegory, enough
representation of an artist's psyche in his/her word(s) of art to,
through sufficient (and this might be incredibly complex) decoding
mechanisms, perceive the "meaning" of the artist him/herself?  Of
course, this would depend on the instance of art, since the artist may
not have put "as much of him/herself" in all of his/her works.  So, to
rephrase:  Is there, or could there be, enough meaning and message,
image and allegory, enough representation of an artist's psyche in
his/her work (in a SINGLE instance of his/her work -- an instance
that was clearly NOT created for this or any related autobiographical
purpose) to perceive the "meaning" of the artist?  Say, in a Van Gogh
Painting?  A symphony by Beethoven ... Etc.?<br>
Yes?<p>

I am quite amorous of that quote.  At times , I feel like these
writings are very insipid, banal and quite ignorant and uneducated, as I
do now.  What to do but keep plundering on, eh?  Traipse through
stimuli, I do, as most do, absorbing a little here, a little there,
making <i>my</i> silly impressions, hoping someone will catch air of
their message.  I suppose this journal needs quite a number of levels
of context__ one being the language barrier, another being
experience.  One might find all of this myriad of meandering musings
vapid as a newborn's first excretion of bodily waste; another might
have already thought through every concept I have approached, but
still enjoys idle reading; yet another could be fascinated.  I suppose
I cannot please 'em all, nor, in fact, should the purpose of this be
to do so, since it is a highly introspective work.  21 pages in 4 1/2
days is rather impressive (to me) for me, however.<p>
