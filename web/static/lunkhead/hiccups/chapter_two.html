<title>Hiccups in the Hallowed Dialect</title>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>

<h2>(10/20/1994)</h2>

It's good to have a journal.  DAMN good, in fact.  It is, I
believe, something I have unknowingly wanted for some time now: a
place to store my thoughts--the thoughts my fickle (and sometimes
FLACCID--I think!) brain refuses to eruct in a coherent fashion after
times squeezes it with its amneasiacish iron mitt.<p>
It is good, as well, to be able to let the senses flow through
my fingers and not steer towards the inclination to backtrack,
reiterate and ornament.  This viceful and quite pretentious
foolishness is quite habit forming when typing on yon computer, in
easy virtual reach of eraser, spell checker and thesaurus.  May this
bountifully empty scratch-pad rid me of technological crutches and
improve my cerebral eloquence.<p>
Now--to keep in touch with my sensibilities, I shall dissect
the only prepurchase pertinent prose in this slowly filling endless
void of while leaflets: "WOODNOTES", the spinal declaration and title
of poetry by which the aforementioned excerpt was taken, by Ralph
Waldo Emerson, in summary, depicts the "death" of an evergreen.  The
first two lines seem to be an excerpt in themselves seeing the closing
ellipses...<p>

<pre>
"In unplanted Maine, he sought the lumberer's gang
 Where from a hundred lakes young rivers sprang..."
</pre>

Olden Maine (1800's) in a forest setting... a vast expanse of
evergreens spanning to each horizon fills my mind with what I hope the
author intended.  An apprentice (perhaps) woodcutter (or maybe just a
poet or philosopher in search of inspiration) seeks out the "gang" of
other woodcutters to make his way in his profession (either way!).<p>
The second line confuses me a tad.  I see rivers sprouting
from actual springs and feeding lakes, seas and oceans, though I could
be a nin-com-poop.  Imagery.<p>
The remainder of Emerson's excerpt is coherent:

<pre>

"He heard, when in the grove, at intervals,              (1)
 With sudden roar the aged pine tree falls,              (2)
 One crash, the death hymn of the perfect tree,          (3)
 Declares the close of its green century.                (4)
 Low lies the plant to whose creation went               (5)
 Sweet influence from every element;                     (6)
 Whose living towers the years conspired to build        (7)
 Whose giddy top the morning loved to gild."             (8)

</pre>

Perhaps this is a reflection (in third person omniscient) of
our young protagonist's thoughts, and woodcutter or not, I admire him
for the quiet pensiveness one feels when examining a closing book, a
coda or final breath.<p>
In (1), he hears the repetitive, quite consistent, persistent,
maybe even mortifying (yes--let us become maudlin) sound of the
apathetic axe, hammering time hewn beauty, severing its grasp of
growth.  The final blow is struck (2) and in a quick rush of sound,
ending in a magnificent crash, the evergreen lies dead (3).  Line four
is quite appealing to me, in all of its inhortte glory, especially the
phrase "green century."  In a non-perinneal plant, the "green time" is
limited to spring, summer, and a portion of autumn.  Winter,
therefore, can be very symbolic of death.  I am quite aware I have
flown off onto an inspired tangent, but, as inspirations usually do, I
am motivated to emote.  For this particular tree (a very prominent
character in our chronicle, I must say), its spring through autumn
lasted for years.  Its winter, though, came unnaturally by the blow of
a man's hatchet, as if on December 21, the beautiful fall turned pure
white, evil and cold.  The leaves of other trees disintegrated, frost
permeated the air and death hung like a cloud, showering the world
with white crystals of dissolution.  The evergreen lies dead among the
grass and humus (5).  It was made, as says line six, by each sweet
juice that nature could offer, obviously in vain.  The imagery is
beautiful in the two closing lines.  Towers--whirling level upon level
of branches constructed tedious moment by tedious moment over years
that may have seen the rise and fall of multitudes of the ones that
gave them demise.  I see the word 'gild' as "to shroud in
mystery... to obscure in a fanciful, wondrous way."  The last line is
obvious, then, and nature's fall is complete as the resounding "death
hymn" of this tree.<p>

Words for the day:<br>
<pre>
--Sacrosanct:
  Having a sacred character by means of the way
  it was derived instead of genuinely.
</pre>
For example: A band or group of musicians create a song.  If the song
is dubbed <i>sacrosanct</i>, it is considered <i>sacred</i> or
'cherished' because of the people who created it, not because it has
an inherent, eternal nature of its own.  (I use the word
<i>eternal</i> in the same sense as I have heard <i>timeless</i> to
describe music... ie, the Beatles.)<p>

<pre>
--Melange:
  A mixture of often incongruous elements.
</pre>
Example:  I would not have referred to the stirfry Loyal prepared last
night as a <i>melange</i> had he not included squirrel femur.<p>
<hr>

--Godel, Escher, Bach chapter 5 ... on recursion--<br>
To be more specific, on recursion in Music:<br>
The listener apparently has a musical <bold>stack</bold>, shallow
though it might be, that lets your mind <bold>push</bold> a tone
center upon as you listen to a piece that modulates.  When the current
tone center resolves, the suspended tone center (the one that was
<bold>pushed</bold> onto the musical stack) is retrieved, resumed,
heightening the overall tension of the piece.  What is, in fact, a
melange, is also an intelligently connected series of recursive tone
centers.<p>
To describe this phenomenon in one of my own songs, I shall consider
"<i>A Fool Fancying Cliches</i>."<br>
The song begins in a very clear A as a tonal center.  This
introduction progresses through a clear chord sequence which finalizes
in a smooth modulation to C as a tonal center.  This modulation
simply arpeggiates<br>
<br>
IMAGE<br>
<br>
the leading tone 7th chord then replaces that root note with a
semi-tone lower pitch which happens, interestingly (and quite
pre-planned) enough, to be the dominant of C ... G7.  Now, the
descriptions in GEB of Bach's work of this sort involved transitions
to a more similar key (more similar than C major is to A major,
anyhow), namely the dominant of the original tone center.
Nevertheless, I am using the same idea.<p>
Implementing Hofstadter's "stacks in music" idea, the mind, while
hearing "Fool..." pushes the A onto the stack believing it will be one
day (or minute, in this case) <i>popped</i> back into the foreground.
After "fool" meanders through a concise chord progression establishing
C as the tone center, it, without apparent forethought, pops A back
onto center stage.  This, directly, reflects the method Back used in
many of his pieces:<br>
Back took the form XXYY and literally beat it to death.  X & Y were
each a different theme (or, sometimes, variations on the same theme),
first worked through one tone center then modulated to the dominant of
that tone center.  As the form dictates, there is a sudden jump back
to the original tone center as the X is repeated.  My mistake--Y is he
opposite of X--first the dominant, then the original...  Anyway, my
point is made.<p>
Even though "fool" does not use the "Y", the same idea of modulation
then sudden <bold>POP</bold> is preserved in each section of the
song.  A short <bold>Y</bold>-type "interlude" after fool might be
optimum as I observe my work.<br>
<i>I shall consider!</i><p>

<pre>
--Heterarchy:
  A family of processes, all interconnected, none of which is on a
  "highest level."
</pre>
<hr>
Problem--To write a song that is "truly" recursive... in that it
calls itself somewhere, like a procedure to calculate the factorial
of a number (in that sort of simplistic elegance):<br>
<pre>
* PROCEDURE FACTORIAL (NUMBER)
    { IF NUMBER == 1 THEN RETURN(1)
      RETURN(FACTORIAL(NUMBER - 1)) }
This is, perhaps, a difficultly analogous example.  We shall see.
* PROCEDURE MELODIC_FACTORIAL (MELODY)
    { IF MELODY == 1 THEN RETURN(1)
      RETURN(MELODIC_FACTORIAL(MELODY-1))) }
</pre>
To implement this procedure correctly, an isomorphism must be set up
between <i>numbers</> and a <i>melody</i>:<br>
<br>
IMAGE<br>
<br>
For the sake of simplicity and the lack of a multiplicative function
in music, I shall use summation.  Also, because I flubbed up my
procedure definition (the last line should read :
RETURN(FACTORIAL(NUMBER - 1) + NUMBER)), things may seem unclear
(coupled with my incorrect definition of factorial), but since I am up
to my penumbra in this already, I shall continue.<p>
First, the entire melody is fed into the procedure, which calls itself
with the melody missing the last note, which calls itself with the
melody missing the last two notes and so on until only the first note
is passed, returning the first note.  Up and up it goes through the
returning recursive structure until finally the output is a string of
notes starting with the first, then the first and second, then the
first, second and third, and on and on, until finally, the whole
melody.  Since the initial chord sequence is C-B-A-B-G for the entire
melody, there would occur, after the nifty procedure has done its
deed, many abrupt chord changes, and though this is only akin to
modulation, one can speculate, using this formulation as a model, on
a larger melody that contains harmonic modulation which has been fed
into such a procedure.<p>
Also, what if this was intertwined with other melodies, that, at
sporadic or pre-planned intervals, called each other by predetermined
rules?<br>
<br>
IMAGE<br>
<br>
How many songs could you create from this?  A <i><bold>DAMN</bold></i>
lot.  In each Meta-Melody, you have three paths, each of which you are
free to pick.  A meta-melody can be as simple as "Melody 1" or as
complex as:  Melody 1 -> inv. Melody 1 -> Melody 1 -> Melody 2 ->
tr. Melody 1 -> Melody 1 -> inv. Melody 1 -> Melody 2 -> Melody 1 ->
Melody 3.<p>
--I realize the "factorial" example and the "meta-melody" example are
very different thematically, though I think both could use lots of
thought -- perhaps be combined.  One should possibly play the result,
as well, to judge the silliness factor.<p>

Synonyms for the day:
<pre>
--IDEA              These came in a rush because of my
  CONCEPT           own critique of my own formulations
  CONCEPTION        on a previous page.  In specific, I con-
  THOUGHT           vinced myself I had used the word
  NOTION            "idea" too often in a single sitting.
  IMPRESSION--
</pre>
An <i>idea</i> evokes the image of a mental formulation (and I shall
use the word 'formulation' frequently in this essay-type-thing; hence
its absence from yon list o' synonyms.), though not just any old
mental formulation, but usually a unique and undiscovered (former to
the idea itself, of course) one.  Concept, on the other hand, can and
should be thought of as <i>NOT</i> necessarily a unique "idea", and
conception more refers to the process of conceiving than to the
actual concept.<p>
<i>Thought</i> might be imagined as perhaps a simpler form of idea or
concept, not having to be unique or contrived, but either.  Also, this
word may be used in a nostalgic or reflective sense frequently (more
frequently than the others, anyhow!).<p>
The indistinct nature of <i>notion</i> can be found in the oft-use
phrase "vague notion."  Notions are particularly unanalyzed thoughts
or ideas, and perhaps even an accidental mental hiccup.<p>
The last of these synonyms (impression) seems the immediately more
lucid to my mind.  Impressions are thoughts or notions formed because
of <i>sensory stimuli</i>.<p>
Bitchin' cookies, aye?<br>
I have a notion that many ideas of my own conception throughout this
journal may not give the impressions of coherent concepts that my
thoughts at the time reflected!  Whoop!<p>
<pre>
--Words for the day:
* Sagacious:
  by, with or having a keen sense of perception.
</pre>
Some may find my meanderings in this journal quite sagacious or shrewd;
others may find them droll and a bit odd.  Still others may espy both
of these qualities, though, outwardly showing my negativism, I suspect
most, with perceptions of bias and hardened clay, will nee neither.<p>
<pre>
* Daft:
  silly or foolish --
  perhaps even unsane.
</pre>
Expounding on the above example, could I be so hopeful that if my
writings are not descried as in any way acute, then perhaps at least
one may find humor in their daftness?<p>
