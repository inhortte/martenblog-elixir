<h1>Chapter 26</h1>

<h2>(10/28/1994)</h2>

It was three-forty PM.  the sameness, however, of every other
three-forty PM had not particularly soaked in to Julia's thick,
adolescent skull.  Her mind was, in stead, full of the energy felt
during her final class of each day, athletics.  She played
basketball.  It might be a wise statement, or even more an
<i>accurate</i> statement, to say that basketball was Julia's
"thing".  School for the day had ended and the groundhog was pouncing,
spinning in the air, landing gleefully on the trampoline, as he was
most every day (save those annoying few per month).<p>
Julia stood mindlessly at the intersection as Mark approached.  This
was not an unusual thing. Mark was not an especially unique or
attractive person with his freckled, boyish face and thin, wire glasses
perched on his nose..  The round lenses and beatlesque framing hair
might have  indicated his mother's lost lust for the late John Lennon,
but the chubby middle and less than elegant stride could say, just as
well, he was following in the footsteps of a foolish, beer drinking,
couch potato-like father figure (an american cliche?).  No respectable
athletic 16 year old with youthful,, rounded hips and long, auburn
hair might possibly consider his company outside of the educational
process, which is surely a forced situation.  But, not being an
unusual occurance that Mark approached, Julia, knowing their closeness
of homefront, really saw no way out.  Or perhaps she still mused over
thoughts of thirty minutes earlier.<p>
After an eternal span of approximately one minute and thirty seconds,
a reasonable gap in traffic happened upon their little stretch of
street.  Mark quickly lumbered through the absence of cars, only to
find, halfway into this staggering lope, Julia not at his side, but
casually walking several yards behind.  The groundhog was laughing
gleefully, batting his eyes at mythical vehicles amongst which he was
deftly dodging.  Mark barked at Julia in a high, strained voice some
half-intelligible phrase indicating the need for haste.  Julia, lost
in a basketball court beyond, kept her dreamy stride and met Mark at
the other side unscathed (much to the apparent apathy of the new
deluge of vehicles now scurrying through their previous walkway).<p>
In a fit of stupidity, Mark glowered and emitted a scolding soliloquy
from his lips, directed at Julia's huge, blue eyes and powdered face.
The groundhog, seeing his opportunity, took out this trusty rubber
mallet and thonked a nearby taxicab driver.  The driver looked rather
puzzled, as one might suspect.  Julia's eyes narrowed, her lips
puckered in a cute, possibly sexy, way, and the gentle lines on her
cheeks hardened.  "I was COMING," was all she said.  Clumsily and in a
painstaking manner, Mark, noticing his impudence, blathered a few
words of apology.  They dripped like drool to the sidewalk, disgusting
Julia's fragile countenance with a fatalistic "splat".  Thus they
began their journey homeward.<br>

--Autumn is, to me, the most nostalgic of seasons.  Why the cool
weather effects me in a sentimental wave of sudden, aleatoric
flashbacks is a mystery, though.  Was I the most emotionally sensitive
during these months of most years?  I would not think so, but memories
of other months do not come splashing on my shores in their
corresponding counterparts years after the fact like the late fall and
winter's chill pricks at my mind, pulling tears I cannot comprehend
from the corners of my eyes.<p>
Surely this happened before, but the first time I <i>RECALL</i>
(though I do recall recalling there were previous times, though those
actual instances seem lost) having been drowned in this undertow of
nostalgia is late fall of 1990, while I was working at Conan's Pizza
in Austin.  It was a slow night.  I remember Scott Lentz and Ryan
Flanigan working with me.  I was standing outside the back door,
watching the white of my breath cloud the atmosphere in front of me.
Keith Teal, the assistant manager, stepped out with me.  We stared
down at the silly hopscotch board we had chalked onto the asphalt of
the parking lot behind the long complex of commercial outlets on the
corner of Research Boulevard and Anderson Mill Road.  I said the same
words I am writing now:  "Why does the winter make me feel like this?"
I don't remember his response, though it would be a benevolent gift for
my maudlin mind to one day let me.<p>
These things that make me feel are so difficult to translate into mere
words.  Or is my grasp of our language not sufficient?  Or, if, like
Godel's theorem in Mathematics ported to language, is there not any
system (of set of systems) of self expression that can express every
"truth" in the human mind?<p>
It's purely relational, I know, but why winter and late fall and not
summer?  The sweltering, evil heat?  heh.<p>
The senses have sublimed, they can touch the fickle nerves that are
numbed by the absence of cold.  Every passing breeze and every
consonance trickling from the nearby stereo greet me with something
that surpasses intellectuality.  Are they tweaking a gene, an instinct
that lies hidden in the irrational animal?  I want to touch the daft
silliness and melt with the hurt and emotion.<p>

Words for the day:
--elide:
  to curtail, take out or omit.
</pre>
"Elide" is a word used commonly in linguistics.  the apostrophe is an
example of a simple elision, which should be apparent from the
knowledge of the apostrophe's function and the definition given
above.  I can think of many grandiose uses of this colourful word in
situations outside of linguistics.  One such is the way Marcie's
feelings and emotions are elided from her father's consideration.
They are snipped from the edges leaving only what Doug Bump wants to
see of a daughter whom he clearly (to anyone but him, that is)
misunderstands, whom he quite obviously (again, to anyone but him)
mistakes for some apparition he has conjured from the depths of his
sense that depicts "what a good, Christian daughter ought to be."
Silly Doug may be smashed by the reality one day of his daughter
eliding him from her life because of his consistent lack of fondness
for fact.<p>
<pre>
--lurid.
</pre>
"Lurid" is quite a diverse word, actually, and one well chosen for
Halloween.  Ghastly pale in appearance when speaking (or writing!) of,
say, a human or ghoul would be a first of accurate definitions.
Lurid is also a greyish yellow/orange colour... sickeningly pallid.
The definition I am the most lured, to, though, is "lurid" as the
light of a red, flickering, fiery mystery screaming with clutching
claws through a muddy fog.  Lurid can also be yet another synonym for
"melodramatic" and "sensationalism".  Ah, well.<p>
<hr>
--A line which few cross lies within the complex web of nurture, I
believe.  Looking back upon the convoluted fabric that has traced my
past ten years, I Only can speculate the existence of an exact "point"
where (when) I crossed it, myself.  In my Jr. High, or, shall I say,
"Middle School," years, I found a small niche which relied heavily on
a skill I possessed.  This little corner of Fort Stockton Middle
School which I occupied expanded somewhat into a nucleus of others up
until the drizzling out of my years in public school.<p>
Mathematics had always been my thing, in a wishful, "nerdy" sort of
way, ever since my aptitude shone through in (the earliest remembered
instance) kindergarten (Mrs. Mason's class) when I decidedly remarked
to all that were listening that 10 x 10 = 100 and the addition they
were performing was silly-little-boy stuff.  This was possibly what I
was picturing mentally, however I'm sure my words were a tad more
academic.  Anyhow, throughout my elementary education, I was a "math
nerd," even to the extent that my third grade teacher (Mrs. Espino)
gave my own problem sets (personalized!) to me to do oblivious of the
remainder of the class (of course, they were a tad harder then the
NORM students' work).  I suppose this made me feel special, elite,
"smart".  Smarter than everyone else was my first taste of a sort of
egotism.  During third grade, I would coax a few little boys to work
on math problems instead of frolick on the playground during recess.
These are very amusing thoughts on retrospect.  <p>
During second and third grades, I interacted with two people who would
(one more than the other) have a steering potential in my life.  One
of these humans was Joe Franco, PE "coach" extraordinaire, and lover
of mathematics.  He, as our "relationship" progressed, started loaning
me math books (some of which I still have...) and inspired my initial
interest in calculators.  I suppose fourth and fifth grades were a
lull in these intellectual pursuits (oh fickle little boy was I!), but
sixth, entrance into Middle School, sparked them anew.<p>
My uncle, some time during my fifth grade year, remarked that i may
hold interest in a scholastic competition that began in sixth grade
among schools of the district in the area of math and science.  This
competition was dubbed "UIL" for "University Interscholastic League"
and involved contests in Math, Science, Calculator and Number Sense.
The first two are intrinsic in their meaning.  "Calculator" and
"Number Sense" may bear some explanation.  The former is a speed
test.  Actually, they are both speed tests, the difference in that
"Calculator" allows, as the name implies, the use of a calculator and
is 30 minutes in length, while "Number Sense" disallows use of
anything but the mind and is a mere ten minutes in length.  I
prospered in both (indeed, in all four) over my years involvement, but
"Calculator" was my speciality.  I was DAMN good at UIL Calculator.
DAMN Good.<p>
In fact, Joe Franco had never seen any better, or so he said.  Owl' Joe
had quit his elementary PE job in favour of a 6th grade teaching
position.  Math, of course.  He had also volunteered his services as
UIL calculator sponsor.  Oddly enough, the entry in to 6th grade and
remergence with Joe Franco's services saw, as well, the return of the
other prominent soul from 2nd and 3rd grade (whom I mentioned
earlier).  Coincidence?  Possibly.  The neat part about UIL, besides
the fact that I was DAMN good at it, was the "meets", or tournaments
in different cities for which we all loaded  onto a school bus and
traveled for.  It was great fun for my Jr. High "nerdy" persona I was
extant under.  The <i>most</i> exciting "meets" were the overnight
ones, in which quite a dearth of sleep was imbued.<p>
I think, though I cannot be absolutely sure, that these trips with a
gang of "nerdy" mentality were the first to spark an infancy of
analytical thinking in me.  They were also, however, the beginning of
my hardest to handle "weak side" smothering my persona in favour of a
servile adorer of some female or another.  Beginning with Esmeralda
Rameriz, this trend continued until 1992, sadly enough.<p>
Though the analytical (or the birth of) nature inspired in me came
coupled with a horrific downside (and though these are not connected,
except for in genesis, per se, I find that in my mind, they, until
very recently, were inseparable), it provided a beneficial quality
that shone my light in this small niche and eventually out into the
realm of the unwary commoner.<p>
I would like to put my finger on February 24, 1984, ten and one half
years ago, as the actual point when i realized what I had inside of me
that severed me from neutral grounded serfs.  This was, ironically,
the UIL meet in El Paso, Texas of my 7th grade year.  The significance
that this city played later in my life is obtusely and erratically
related, though skewed into the landslide of my weakness I have
mentioned but enriched with a vibrant growth in intellectuality.<p>
--I have elided much, but the semi-point persists, if perhaps only for
me...<p>
