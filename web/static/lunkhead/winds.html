This short story has a name taken from a song
that myself and Tony Hogard were composing during the summer of 1990.
This tune eventually became 'Cutting the Reins of a Dream', a Sir
Alfred staple, with lyrics completely different from the original
conception.<br>
This is the first verse of what Tony and I wrote in July of
1990:<br><br>
</font><font color="#C00000">
You sparkle when you walk<br>
I am frozen when you talk<br>
Your goldenness has driven me to dream<br>
It is a secret I have carried<br>
Since the winds of January<br>
If only I could break this circuit's stream.<br>
</font><br>
Here it is, in all its benign splendour:

<a name="1">PART I</a>
</h2>

I had been meandering through the streets again in a shroud of
isolation, watching the faces of people who passed, scrutinizing the
curves and dimples and lines, trying to decipher them.  I tried to
turn the impassive eyes towards mine with sheer effort of will,
silently screaming like a neglected child at each pair.  A few did
look [a few always do], but quickly turned away.  I wonder what they
saw in my face.  I wonder if the cryptic curves and dimples and lines
translated to the deep, encompassing loneliness which I felt within.
I wonder if it frightened them.
</p>

<p align="left">
I think that I draw a perimeter around myself and, in a sense, stand
completely still.  I never utter a sound.  Something silent inside of
me dares another to cross.  Perhaps my reflective eyes reveal an
anomaly.  Maybe the curious curves and dimples and lines on my face
summon a soul to trespass into my personal universe.  I never can make
the first verbal contact, though.  A grey, terrifying hand always
holds me back and confines me to this lonely world.
</p>

<p align="left">
Sleepily, I shambled up the steps of a coffee shop after tiring of the
little game I played all alone with the people on the streets.  After
acquiring coffee, I sat on a stool which garnished an ordinary table
and blearily peered about the room.  I had two female companions, each
equipped with her own steaming drink and her own personal world.  One
of them read; the other wrote.  Neither spoke.  There were nothing but
occasional, quiet shuffling sounds to accompany the silence in the
cafe.  I scanned them both for a few foggy instants then turned to
gaze hazily into my cup.  It stared back impassively, reminding me
vaguely of the people outside.
</p>

<p align="left">
What are the chances that a single derelict soul, spoken to by chance
on a random Friday night at a mundane coffee shop in a non-descript
college town, might be one who could put up with each of my
idiosyncrasies, innocent or wicked, agreeable or annoying, fecund or
fruitless, for fifty years?  Or even five years?  Or mayhaps eight
months?  Or only three weeks?  What about the chances that another
soul, sitting three seats to the left, only passively glimpsed, hardly
noticed, quickly forgotten, might be one instead?
</p>

<p align="left">
I had been awake for forty-two hours and odd, fuzzy rings had formed
around the surrounding shapes.  They wobbled and flinched like old men
with many nervous tics.  I felt sure that within moments I would fall
into an unconquerable, involuntary slumber which would quench my
parched mind, eradicate the dizziness and obfuscation, and maybe even
mellow that obdurate feeling of isolation.  My lolling head slipped
from my propping palm and nearly came to an unpleasant rest on the
wooden table.  I wearily caught it before its imminent impact.  A cascade
of hair fell in a semi-circle and my glasses dangled from my ears,
threatening to drop.  One of my companions silently slid from her
chair, pattered across the room, and exited as I lowered my head the
scant remaining distance and plummeted into a pleasant darkness.
</p>

<p align="left">
A peculiar dream came to me while I slept at that table in that coffee
shop.  I sat naked before a fireplace, cross legged, straightened
back, gazing unblinking into its murky void.  As I envisioned the fire
that should have surely been there, a cold emptiness slowly sucked the
heat from my body.  I poked incessantly, often frantically, with a
long metal rod at the black cavity and imagined glowing embers
splintering and scintillating.  They crackled, spit life giving love
and heat, melted my frozen soul, freed me from the chilling grip of
isolation, smoothed the curves and dimples and lines on my face, left
a warm yet pallid mask of happiness in their stead.
</p>

<p align="left">
Then a gout of crimson billowed from that abyss, charged like a
maddened fist from a psychotic bully at my face.  The mouth of the
fireplace suddenly became the circular orifice of my coffee cup
eructing clammy liquid onto the table and into my prostrated nose and
mouth.  I jerked up my dripping head and, disoriented, drank in my
newly disheveled surroundings.  Over half of the corkboard ceiling
tiles were aflame.  Fiery flakes rained from them like fallout.
Tendrils of opaque smoke twisted and slithered as eloquently as
vipers.  Where I indistinctly recalled tables, disfigured debris
ornamented the room.  My sole companion lay trapped under what looked
strangely like the wreckage of a small aeroplane.  A miniature
monolith had fallen through the shattered ceiling and lay crushing her
left leg, wringing blood from her thigh into a thick, spreading pool.
I gaped.  There was a sound in my ears like the screaming of children
on a whorling carosel -- a carosel out of control.
</p>

<a name="2">PART II</a>
</h2>

<p align="left">
In the spring of semester 1995, I attended The University of Houston
at Clear Lake.  During my one semester stay at this establishment of
higher learning, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics, spread
sixteen hours of credit over six classes.  That institution, even
though it counted me only as an anonymous entity, a cold statistic
frozen in the rigid morass of studentdom, saw my greatest success in
the universe of structured education.  I received five As and one B:
rather impressive considering my dismal academic history.  I would
like to accredit this feat to the weather.</p>

<p align="left">
The weather in Houston, Texas during the first few months of 1995
billowed about with an eerie coolness that piqued my mind in a curious
way.  The winds of January supplanted my weary habit of craving people
to satiate my emptiness with a fevered hunger for knowledge.  Why this
feeling persisted even after spring arrived and the sun's hateful heat
bullied the sprightly, chilly winds from the tepid air, I do not
particularly understand.  But the domineering rein of logic guided me
unmercifully into the first days of May when finals frightened all
into a stressful sleeplessness.
</p>

<p align="left">
The University was not very large; most of the important facilities
and classrooms were housed in a single building.  In between my
classes or as a reprieve from studying, I would occasionally walk
aimlessly throughout this building, scanning the other students,
scrutinizing a few, inspecting the lecturers, janitors, and other
sundry employees, resting my mind from the tedium of schoolwork.  It
was the only really lonely thing I did during that span of my life.
On all other occasions I had mathematics, computer science or sleep as
company.
</p>

<p align="left">
I place liability on the lengthening days, on the fleeing winter, so
as months sprinted by, the frequency of my walks increased.  During
many of these rambles there appeared a certain pair of eyes that in
time became familiar.  They seemed to scrutinize in return, pry
something intrinsic from me without consent, send a pang of fear
commingled with curiosity though my body.  The feeling usually waned
quickly, but when it did not, it crawled up my spine and nibbled at my
brain until only a good, long submersion into my studies would
eradicate it.  It frightened me that those eyes threatened to loosen
the chilling grip that motivated me, that imprisoned me.
</p>

<p align="left">
Curiosity triumphed over fear as I saw her more and more often.  At
times, I would break from my studies and stroll simply for the strange
and alluring few seconds while our eyes were locked.  But I never
violated the delicate moment.  Either because of a lack of social
skills or the refusal to shatter the magic of our silent
communication, I did not even offer a passing, hesitant 'hello'.
</p>

<p align="left">
The university library sat commodiously behind a succession of windows
that unpleasantly reflected fluorescent glare from formations of
ceiling fixtures.  The stacks and the students browsing between them
fanned by in the periphery of my vision when I traipsed along the
hallway beside the windows.  I always slowed as the shelves of books
made way for a myriad of oddly positioned tables and chairs.  Her
customary nestling point was near the glittering windows at a large
table which she usually occupied alone.  She sat and intently gazed
down on books, papers and writing utensils which lay strewn across the
table top like clothing in an unkempt bedroom.  Yet most every time
her eyes raised from the menagerie of scattered lore and met my own as
I passed.
</p>

<p align="left">
The air perspired humidity in the almost perpetual heat of early May.
It was dreadful.
</p>

<p align="left">
Half dazed amid the last day of my finals, I staggered along the
hallway adjacent to the library vaguely contemplating sating the
ominous ache in my stomach.  I saw her standing at the library door
exchanging pleasantries with an acquaintance.  My weary mind paused my
body and stood me sleepily among queues of bustling, purposeful
students.  After many uncomfortably stimulating seconds, I tore myself
from her enchanting stare and was effortlessly swept along towards the
cafeteria.  There I dispassionately sat and poked the colourful
vegetables, chewed the bland bread, swirled the artificial beverage,
disdained the uncomfortable chair, ignored the insipid clamour,
neglected the impending test, then stood and blundered back towards
the library.
</p>

<p align="left">
I had been awake for forty-two hours and odd, fuzzy rings had formed
around the surrounding shapes.  They simpered and grimaced as I
squinted sleepily at them.  I sat alone at her typical table and
spread my Software Engineering notes in front of me like clean laundry
to be folded.  Intending rote memorization, I found myself glancing up
distracted at the entrance.  Trying to concentrate, mouthing a few
lines of text, I again noticed my gaze on the door.  Studying was
useless.  Winter was, indeed, long gone.
</p>

<p align="left">
She finally arrived and pranced right up to my table as if she had
expected me to be there.  Her eyes gleamed with a beckoning, resolute
radiance that permeated the rarefied air, simplifying.  Then she
ransacked our sacred shroud of silence and I involuntarily laughed out
loud.  Stunned, she asked what was wrong.  I told her to have a seat
and I would tell her all about it.
</p>


<h2 align="center">
<a name="3">PART III</a>
</h2>

<p align="left">
My throat clenched itself tightly then released like the sweating fist
of a frustrated man.  The smoke danced into my nostrils like bullets
into the chest of an immobile quadriplegic.  The dying girl's pulse
sounded listlessly under my fingers like the dwindling echo of a lost
and frightened spelunker.  After endless minutes of attempting to
dislodge the stubborn slab of metal that maimed her, my arms and will
fell useless at my sides.  I stared at her unconscious face and tried
to pry the closed eyes open with my own, to awaken her from her mortal
coma.
</p>

<p align="left">
My hallucinating mind imagined her as embers splintering and
scintillating as I prodded with my latent thoughts.  Loving arms of
warm flame reached out to encircle me wholly, hold me firmly,
constrain me tenderly.  My limbs, resurrected from fatigue by the
vision, rose to meet the beautiful crimson ribbons that pranced wildly
between us.  Her eyes opened behind the veil of vermilion and her
face became a tapestry of curves and dimples and lines that painted a
thousand different portraits as files of flittering fire traced them.
</p>

<p align="left">
I screamed as my hands plunged through the curtain.  The loving arms
became seething streams of pernicious apathy, burning, boiling the
skin of my fingers away, cackling acrid shouts of suffocating smoke
into the air.  My companion's embers smoldered gray and faded like the
waning ashes of an abandoned campfire.  My head spun; I was bewildered
and blistered.  I stumbled backwards amidst the debris, away from the
fire, away from the dead girl, into the wall and window beside my
original seat.
</p>

<p align="left">
Much too tired to panic, my brain struggled to tune out the insanity
and lucidly take stock of my situation.  I was on the third floor of a
coffee house which was slowly being incinerated.  The path to the
spiral staircase which beckoned freedom was choked with flame and
rubble.  Clouds of smoke encroached, threatening to envelop and digest
me.  Shrill sirens screamed from beyond the window behind me, from the
street below where a horde had gathered to watch and impede the
firemen.
</p>

<p align="left">
After minutes of frustration, I gave up trying to open the window.
Pressing my face against the glass, I peered down and gesticulated for
attention to no avail.  Painfully grabbing a chair with my tattered
hands, I hurled it through the obstinate pane.  Flesh from my
blackened fingers cracked and tore, oozing a thick, reddish-orange
fluid while the roaring of the inferno behind me seemed to slightly
pause for the piercing shatter of glass.  People pointed, gaped,
yelled and the mob swirled and changed, admitting a rescue team with a
net assembly.  They had come prepared.
</p>

<p align="left">
Vicious shards of the remaining pane jutted nefariously from the base
of the window.  I kicked ruthlessly at them, clearing the way for a
crouch on the sill which would preamble a jump into the net.
Clumsily, I clambered to my perch and lingered, swaying slightly,
eyeing the throng.  Every pair of eyes was focused on mine.  Then I
thought I glanced the girl who had left the coffee shop before the
blaze.  Her mouth was twisted into a charming, worried frown; her eyes
pulled incessantly at mine.  For a few seconds everything else was
frozen, then I pushed off ungracefully, intent on enjoying the
plummet.
