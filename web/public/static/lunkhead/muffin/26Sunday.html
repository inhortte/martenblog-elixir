Yearning for you, my love.
</font></h1>

It is saturday night, or, actually, sunday morning early, and I sit in
Fort Worth before this computer, this macintosh, typing words which I
desperately hope you will soon read.  I have just taken a gargantuan
swig from the bottle of Grand Mariner sitting atop the 'fridge.  I can
already feel it coursing quickly into my veins.  I miss you.  You are
in Brussels, possibly asleep still [it is 8:30 a.m. there].  I long to
be there with you.  We fought on the telephone today.  I am sorry.
All I want is for you to reach your hand to my face and wipe away
these silly tears of loneliness.  I simply sit in this place listening
to its occupants converse about which blood pressure medication
creates the most drowsiness.  I miss you, Brynn.  I never want to hurt
you but I realize that I do.  Help me stop my madness.  Please.

At one point in our conversation you stated: "This is a problem."  It
made an indelible impression on me.  I called you again because I
wanted to tell you I love you and I miss you and I wanted frantically
to hear your voice, a sparkle amid the teeming darkness.  I love you.
I solely wish to be able to heal your anguish, your pallor of apathy,
give meaning to your life.  I feel so helpless.  That is the key to my
madness, my love.  I feel so <em>fucking</em> helpless.  So I flail.
I ring you up and say all of the wrong things when my intention was to
give you only my love.  That is all I have, after all.  I try to
intellectualize it and fail.  So I stand naked, Brynn, before you with
only my honesty.  Will you forgive my mistakes?  Will you marry me?
Will you marry this fool?  I love you.  This fool loves you.  And
after all of the bullshit is said and done, all of the
<strong>torpid</strong> rationalizing and analization has been set
forth like evidence to a jury, all the brash blows and carless
caresses have been stroked, I will still stand naked before you,
Brynn, with my honesty, my love.

If you need space, that is what I have to give you, <em>every</em>
time.  I love you for who you are, and like I told you on the
telephone today, I love everything about you:
<ul>
<li>I love your words strung together that enter my ears effortlessly.
<li>I love your hands and their trembling caressing circles they
scribe on my skin.
<li>I love your art; your drawings mesmerize me.  I wish to devour,
memorize every curve and line.
<li>I love your smile, your face, the scintillating glow of your
eyes.  They enchant me.
<li>I love your writing, the paragraphs of patient penning that
motivate me to turn the rusted gears of my own creativity.  You are my
inspiration.
<li>I love your warm flesh which entices me to a passion I have never
felt, coupled with the florid glow of your shining eyes, I can name no
greater beauty.
<li>I love your understanding of me, how you can interpret my petty,
wizened diatribes as if they were your own, honestly.  You have shown
me more about life, more about myself, than anyone.
</ul>
I love you, Brynn.  I stand in a desert of harsh reality.  You stand
meters away.  Our eyes lock.  We have two choices.  One, to walk
efortlessly away and seek our own, individual oases.  Two, to join
hands and create an oasis of the world with our love.  I choose number
two, my love, cheezy as though it may sound; old fashioned as it might
be.  But I adore you.  I want to spend my life in your arms.  Solace,
Brynn.  <strong><em>SOLACE</em></strong>.  I love you.  I shall love
you forever.  I wish to return to my home.... to you.<br>
Your fettered fishstick,<br>
