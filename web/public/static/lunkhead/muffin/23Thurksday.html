Life without Brynn is no life at all, after all...</font></h1>

I have purchased white wine, as I said I would, in thoughts of you,
and I swig it slowly, plaintively, toasting you with every sip.  You
are sleeping, surely, again, in Amsterdam.  It is 11 p.m. here.  All
is quiet.  One would think I would go insane.  Mayhaps I need music.
My stack of compact discs leers at me with an impassion that reminds
me of a smirk, though more subtle.  I should pick one and lay it
flat-wise in the CD player of this computer, let the lilting strands
of some opretta invade the air with dignity.  I hesitate, however.
The silence is golden, in a sense.  Have you ever wondered why 'in a
sense' and 'innocence' are homophones?  I pick 'Polytown'.  You need
to hear this CD.  I think you would appreciate it.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
For some odd reason, I am printing a picture of a DNA molecule to mail
to you.  It perplexes me that these little helixes hold all that we
are in their convoluted strands.  There are only four letters, four
different proteins that are the alphabet of a DNA molecule, and
arranged determinalistically, they <em>SPELL</em> the contents of our
existence.  Genetics frightens me, especially how it is used these
days to make money for large corporations.  Imagine this [this is
real]:  At Texas A&M University, they pay students to do research on
the fatty acids present in the flesh of cattle so they can synthesize
new DNA and create a more 'meaty' cow for industry's sake.  Is this
not evil?  Large corporations that raise cattle in the confines of
dingy barrack-like farm houses pay for all of it so they can become
rich.  It disgusts me.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
I begin my third glass of wine.  I would like to make a toast before I
begin my initial sip.  This is to you, Brynn.  You are my tranquility
base, a home for happiness, a solace for serenity.  A thought of you
dispells the niggardly demons of desperate dispair.  I drink.  I love
you.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
Everything seems so fucking <strong>GRIPPING</strong> right now.  I
want to run but I have no destination.  I want to fly but I have no
wings.  The wine courses quickly to my frontal lobe.  It does its best
to subdue my loneliness, but, as always, fails, makes me realize that
this meandering night is like all others before I am again with you.
I sit and write of my longing to satiate my emptiness.  Soon I shall
be able to write of beauty instead whilst in your scinillating
presence, whilst sharing a magnificent life with you.  <em>God</em>, I
feel sappy.  Sappy is not a bad thing, however, for it instills me
with the ability to berate the stupid, stagnant cynicism which has
festered for so long in my hara.  I love you.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
I recall writing, once, quite a while ago, in the computerized journal
that I first gave you to show you an inkling of what you would be
getting involved with by immersing yourself in this relationship,
about sitting lonely and bereft in my apartment in houston staring at
the terminal screen and wondering if I was insane.  I imagined it
exploding, spontaneously, into pernicious shards of plastic and glass
and eviscerating my face.  And why shouldn't it do so?  That is a
feeling that I still have, sitting here in Fort Stockton, bedraggled
by solitude:  the idea that everything I have ever learned about how
the universe is <em>supposed</em> to function could suddenly be
false.  Unrealistic.. yeah, I suppose.  Sobering, however.. that,
too.  Tell me I am not crazy, Brynn.  I don't want to be
crazy.</font></p>

Here is the entry verbatim:<br>
</font><br>
<font color="EEA080" size="5">
For some curious but usual reason, I have some sophistic fright that
the raging electrical storm that is visiting my neighbourhood will
dispatch a fairly fearsome bolt of cosmic fire through the pervious
atmosphere, to my newly secured home, and into my meek and obedient
terminal, turning it momentarily into a ball of searing heat and
loosing hundreds of shards of shattered glass towards my pliable face.
Is this normal?

Looking back, it makes me very happy that I printed all of that drek
to give to you on the night before I left for Juneau.  I remember what
you said as we sat together in Kevin Harun's office, at the computer,
in the office of The Alaska Center for the Environment.  You said, "So
even when you are in Juneau, I will have Bob to fill my days."  I
remember being very happy at this comment.  I also recollect feeling
very shy and touching you very cautiously whilst you sat in the chair
beside me, giving you small shoulder messages, lightly touching your
cheek.  All the while, Brian played in the copy room.  You don't know
how much I miss you right now.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
Okay, my <strong><em>LOVE</em></strong>, I have just spent quite some
time creating a script which changes the noun and the adverb on the
'Brynn and Bob's Love Page'.  That is, in the title:  Bob is Quite
____ with Brynn; and in the conclusion:  I love you ____!  I am hoping
with an ardent fervour that you enjoy my diversity!  Ooouh!  The music
from our home pages plays repeatingly from the speakers before me.  I
wish you could hear it in the cafe so distant from me in which you descry
my writings, for it adds to the whole <em>effect</em>, my loveling.  I
smile.  I miss you.  I love you desperately.  You know how the soles
of your feet start paining you after a while of applying consistent,
flat pressure on them?  Well, I am experiencing that at this moment,
my love.  I have been sitting in this chair in an odd manner:  I am,
indeed, actually, <em>squatting</em>.  My feet are sound against the
seat of the chair, pressed to my buttocks which hover
<strong>above</strong> the seat.  My legs are bunched up and can be
easily touched by my chin.  My chest is flush with my thighs while I
lean [now] painfully forward.  I shall straighten and extend myself
now to alleviate the pain, my love!  That is much better.  I take
another drink of wine, think of you, pause and struggle to suppress
the tears which strive to fall from my eyes.  I miss you,
Brynn.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
Do you remember the short story that I gave to you to read back in
September?  It was entitled 'The Winds of January'.  Well, I am going
to add it to the links on the other page of various interesting stuff
accessable to you because I would like to know your opinion of it now,
after knowing me for so long.  If you have time to read it again,
please do.  Your thoughts on my writings very much tittilate my
fancy.  <em>God</em>, I love you.  *smile*  I blush from afar.  I wish
I could hold you tightly and alleviate this horrific
solitude.</font></p>

I have 3/4 of an inch of wine left in my transparent glass.  It is the
remaining beverage.  Heh... I have drunk it all, my love.  I have
drunk it <strong><em>ALL</em></strong>!  We must imbibe white wine
together soon, Brynn, for it will happify me, an hopefully you, as
well.  And the last drops beckon me to let them mingle with my
saliva.  Oh, Brynn.  Why must you be so far away?  I toast you again,
with the final <em>swig</em> of wine:  This is to the prominent
feeling you give to me, the feeling of <strong>importance</strong>, of
a <em>purpose</em>, of stark reality, of the fact that I am loved and
there is no reason to whiningly fret over pointless details.  I love
you, Brynn.  Marry me cowart?  Wow... that just gave me an erection!
I want you so <strong>FUCKING</strong> badly right now!  Let us spend
a life of wondrous rapture together!  What do you say?  Hmmm???  I
love you.

My eyes ache to espy your beauteous form.<br>
My tongue aspires to taste your luscious flesh.<br>
My skin yearns to press against your soft body.<br>
My ears pine to hear your lilting voice.<br>
My nose longs to smell your sensuous scent.<br>
Oh, Brynn... I miss you...  so much!<br>
-bob</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
ps, I have just traipsed outdoors to espy the moon, gaze at it with an
absent adoration, kiss my tattoo, and scream to the night that I love
you.
