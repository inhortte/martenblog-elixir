My love!  I have just spoken to your rapturous countenence on the
telephone.  You are far from me, but still inhabit the comforting
beddings of my heart.  I hope you have enjoyed the nuances of the web
pages thus far.  There are some problems [such as pictures which
didn't scan very well], but I shall fix them and your subsequent
visits to peruse the contents will surely end in uninhibited bliss.
I, obviously, had quite big fun with the glass w/ fork picture you
created.  <em>God</em>, I love it.  I will install larger ones in the
portrait gallery tomorrow.  The stored pictures are very large, so, in
the bigger portraits, you can discern the wondrous detail!  Your
curves are a tapestry which would entice any mathematician!  Your work
is a beauty to behold.  I recall a few days a go the moment I scanned
it, staring with envy at your art.  I wish I could draw, my love!
You should teach me!  *smile* I love you...</font></p>

The dimness of this room reflects my demenor.  I am without a great
deal of light right now, gloomy even, to an extent.  I spend my days
with books in palm, eschewing my loneliness the best I can manage.  In
the end, however, I stare into space and think of you and how your
hands feel gliding over my skin, how your lips feel gently pretty
softly onto my neck.  And I cry.  I <strong>cry</strong>!  Why
shouldn't I?  You give to me emotion I never thought I could possess,
a benevolent beauty which expunges the black apathy of the huddling
mass of normality.  Soundlessly, I sigh.  Soon I shall fall into a
troubled sleep, awaken with frequent starts, reach to find nothing at
my side: no you.  Sleeping with you is perfection.  Being able to
awaken and find you lightly breathing, smiling in that peculiar manner
you do as you sleep, tantalizes me, makes my writhe with
anticipation.  I miss you, Brynn.  I miss you madly.</font></p>

I did mention this on the telephone, but I wish to reiterate:  Some of
the things my uncle said to me about you and me and our future were
beautiful.  They made me struggle to hold back tears.  And I believe
it to be true:  We must always [toujours!] believe in each other first
and foremost, put one another before everything else, and follow our
dreams together.  Then all else will fall into place.  Isn't that
beautiful?  My uncle said that when he married my Aunt, he and she
spoke of this and let it be, let their lives exist in this manner...
bliss:  it is bliss.  And he said let nothing come between us,
<em>nothing</em>, not children, not money, not family, not friends.
God, his words made so much sense.  It echoes our thoughts, the ones
we have spoken of together, about salvation being in our life
together.  I love you so much, Brynn.  Je t'adore maintenant et
toujours.  Je dois passer ma vie avec toi.  Tu me donnes le bonheur.
Je t'aime.</font></p>

I adore your art, my love.  I hope that is apparent!  Remember the
three things you sent me from Madrid?  One was the brilliant sketch
featured on the love home page along with our b/w photo.  The other
two will be featured in the portrait gallery when I expand it
[tomorrow!].  I am smiling so ornately that my cheeks ache with the
effort.  Heh.  What can I type which will reflect this emotion
adequately?  I am ecstatic!  Happy, my love!  And this is just a
miniscule smidgen of what it shall be like when you and I hold one
another again at long last... in less than a week.  My head is
spinning.  It is nearly four in the morning and I should be dreaming
fabulous images of you and I in Euroe, romping fantastically, hand in
hand, amid the winding streets of Paris, of Berlin, of Florence, of
Amsterdam, of Copenhagen, of Prague, of Budapest, of Athens...  *grin*
I love to indulge in lucid fantasies about you, my love.  And the most
poignantly beauteous part about it all is the fact that each little
daydream, nightdream, happy swirling thought about you and I will come
true.   Love, cowart?  I miss you desperately, my loveling.  We shall
walk the high roads hand in hand, stride the low roads clutching
closely, weave a mighty web... the tapestry of our life.</font></p>
