Sloshed and Melancholic<br>
(what a surprise)</font></h1>

I am unsure how to begin this letter.  I feel like an idiot.  And I
miss you like hell.  I'm drinking Zima and crying my fucking eyes out
before an apathetic terminal that mocks me with a partial, tenuous
reflection of my face.  I wish I could be there with you, but I am
not.  I am <em>here</em> instead.  It was very sobering, your hanging
up on me this evening.  I stood there hapless and helpless like I had
just lost every important item in my life in a single instant.  I am
sorry, Brynn.  I drove you away like a subborn, foolish brute.  My
words flailed about me and left me with nothing but thier echoes
decaying in the silence.  I miss you.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
And I peruse the thought of not having you in my life.  It brings a
blackness like no other, a suffocating shroud of meaninglessness.  Why
am I so stupid?  <strong>I need to <em>fucking</em> give you space
when you need it, <em>EVERY</em> time you need it</strong>.  I am a
fool.  Oh, my love, you are going to marry a <strong>fool</strong>.
The events of the night were a slap on my face, a very firm and needed
slap.  What you did was the right thing: hanging up on me.  I feel
like such an ass, a pusillanimous doof.  <strong>DOOF</strong>,
Brynn!  I don't want to lose you.  I don't want to lose you.  I do
not want to lose you!  I miss you so much.

I meant what I said on the telephone in a quite grandiose way, in a
very perfect and fateful manner.  This is all crap, this humdrum that
I place upon myself, this torpid quagmire in which I tread, only
slightly keeping my head above the surface.  I subject you to so much
of my demons' flailing elegies, requiems and dirges sung throaty and
melodramatic.  I want to sit quiescent with you in our flat, give you
any space you need, sit happily in our room writing as you draw in the
den, tranquilly.  I long, pine, yearn for this future.  And I sit here
crying, pitiful in this <em>fucking</em> town wishing for a future
that I desperately do not want to destroy with my slithering, sulking
bullshit.  Wishing for you.  For <strong>YOU</strong>.  I love you.
Your final words to me today resonate throughout everything I do:  "I
love you like hell, Bob, but I have to go now."  I never want to hurt
you, Brynn.  I want to see your smile... simple and real.
<strong><em>God</em></strong>, I only want to hold you right now,
gently, and listen to you sleep.  I am sorry, so <em>FUCKING</em>
sorry, Brynn...  I need another Zima.  I need to bash my stupid head
against the wall.

I desperately wish I could recall the words I wrote to you in that
letter, the one which I wrote on Christmas, the one that I stated was
the most important thing I have ever written.  There was something you
quoted from it on the telephone the other day [monday, mayhaps].  It
was something about flitting through life and screaming flailing words
into the atmosphere to people who simply go on with their own lives,
let it pass.  Without you, Brynn, all of these words trickle, puddle
and evaporate without a single eye or ear's heed.  You've given me a
magical understanding of myself and the world in which I live that no
other has approached.  That sounds overwrought and cheezy as hell, but
it is true.  It is absolute fact.  Clarity has descended on my life
since we have been together.  Ooooh, I miss you.  Oh, there I go with
my non-sequitors.  Oh, my love, please forgive me for my plodding,
stumbling gait which trips my legs and leaves me prone and helpless on
the apathetic ground.  I never want to hurt you or make you sad.  I
love you.  My wish is for your happiness, and I have failed you
extensively today.  You should have hung up on me far before you did.
Oh, Brynn.  I meander and babble.  I love you.  And I chastise myself
to no end in this large, bleak plain of scrub brush and wizened
weedlings which gawk at me like accusing parents.

<p align="center"><font color="#EE0000">
I love you.<br>
This is all that matters.<br>
I love you <em>so</em> much.<br>
Will you marry me?
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">
I have just spoken to you on the telephone.  I love you madly.  Your
voice makes every trepidation melt away.  I am so happy to have you in
my life... and I am assured that we have a beauteous future which will
be ever fecund.  I yawn.  I smile.  I think of your smile.  We shall
traipse happily amid the fields of divine wonder.  I wish to kiss
you.  10 days, my love!  Ten days...</font></p>
