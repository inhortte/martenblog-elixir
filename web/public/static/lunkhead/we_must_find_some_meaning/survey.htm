<h4>Jayson Frankthurk</h4>
<b>colour?</b><br>

I don't understand. What is a colour? Is that in any way related to a
colon? If so my favorite colon is a green colon.<br><br>

<b>musical group?</b><br>

I refuse to answer this question. I have no single favorite. But Pink
Floyd is playing right now so I'll say Pink Floyd.That is really what I
think. Oh by the way...<br><br>

<b>chemical element?</b><br>

I didn't realize this was a drug survey. I've only tried acid so I'll
say acid.<br><br>

<b>word?</b><br>

Ummm, Ummm, Ummmmmm, this is hard, there are so many useful ones. I
think I like blather though. Or was that I like to blather?<br><br>

<b>phrase?</b><br>

"I'm ok, I'm by the butter." You should see the number of chicks I've
picked up with that one.<br><br>

<b>instrument?</b><br>

I will make the giant leap that you are referring to music instruments.
If you were being general I'd say an ice-cream scoop, but since I assume
you mean musical instruments I'll say spork.<br><br>

<b>utensil?</b>

I will make the giant leap that you are referring to music utensil. If
you were being general I'd say a spork, but since I assume you mean
musical utensils I'll say an ice-cream scoop.<br><br>

<b>corporate entity?</b><br>

I kill you now!<br><br>

<b>lyric?</b><br>

If I don't have a favorite musical group what the hell makes you think I
have a favorite lyric? But Pink Floyd is playing now so I'll say "All
good things must end. The straightest roads will bend. The fuskdjelk and
blusdjfe moon, soon they're just wrinkled things."<br><br>

<b>animal?</b><br>

Pandora.<br><br>

<b>plant?</b><br>

Plant.<br><br>

<b>food?</b><br>

No thanks, I just had coffee and a kahlua almond fudge pie thing.<br><br>

<b>scent?</b><br>

I really can't smell very well. Just about the only scents I can smell
are very strong ones which generally smell bad, like too much perfume or
too much cologne. I think I prefer no smell.<br><br>

<b>internal organ?</b><br>

Ummm, Ummm, Ummmmmm, this is hard, there are so many useful ones. I
think I like bladders though. Or was that I like to use ice-cream scoops
to remove other's bladders?<br><br>

<b>book?</b><br>

Damn you, did you just sit around and think up the hardest questions
possible? How am I suppose to answer this? There are too many and they
can't be compared. Here, I'll list a couple that come to mind. Zen and
the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance- BTW I'm considering taking a lengthy
road trip sometime in the not to distant future, so if any of you feel
like volunteering a bed and shower for a night I would be most
appreciative.Grendel, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Godel
Escher Bach (if I could only finish it), the Covenant Series, The
Breakfast of Champions,  and so on.<br><br>

<b>author?</b><br>

Bite me.<br><br>

<b>songwriter?</b><br>

Just what drug were you on when you came up with these? Some things just
can't be singled out. I won't waste more space with another list.<br><br>

<b>lyricist?</b><br>

See above ya bastard.<br><br>

<b>place to have a carpet burn?</b><br>

Navel.<br><br>

<b>vehicle in which to travel?</b><br>

One containing 3 or 4 of my good friends and heading to someplace I've
never been.<br><br>

<b>vehicle at which to gaze?</b><br>

A big wheel.<br><br>

<b>supermarket?</b><br>

I dunno, HEB works. Whole Foods has some nifty stuff, but is generally
too expensive.<br><br>

<b>city?</b><br>

Depends on my mood. When I'm reminiscing Galveston is, when I'm enjoying
outside Austin, Austin is, many other cities are extremely cool, but I
haven't lived in them so they aren't substantial enough to be a
favorite. Oh yeah, and College Station is never my favorite.<br><br>

<b>state?</b><br>

Again I need to exist in them longer than a couple days.<br><br>

<b>country?</b><br>

Now you're going too far.<br><br>

<b>constellation?</b><br>

Orion is the only one I can usually find, but Pink Floyd is playing so
I'll say Pink Floyd.<br><br>

<b>speed at which to travel?</b><br>

Well, that's relative.<br><br>

<b>temperature?</b><br>

Cold is nifty. Snow is nifty. Camping on a windy cold mountain by the
rest rooms and being told by the ranger in the morning that you need to
leave is very nifty.<br><br>

<b>carcinogen?</b><br>

Now you're just getting silly.<br><br>

<b>metal which is liquid at room temperature?</b><br>

I take that back... NOW you're getting silly.<br><br>

<b>time signature?</b><br>

5/4<br><br>

<b>key in which to sing?</b><br>

Why do I have to sing IN key? I never did before.<br><br>
