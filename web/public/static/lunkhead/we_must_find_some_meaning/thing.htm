			This is the second column.  It is not nearly as important
			as the first, since it holds little or no useful information.
			You can always mail a burrito to Craig, however.  He likes
			people to mail him burritos immensely.  His address is
			7630 Wood Hollow Dr. #219; Austin, TX 78731.  Yah.
