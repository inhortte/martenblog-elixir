<h2>Real audio files of alfred gunge!</h2>

<p>
  To please the masses, all of these files are 28.8 stereo
  That is, not CD quality.  Actually, not even close.  They do
  provide a reletively good aural skeleton of the music, however, and
  are, as Jesus says, better than nothing.<br>
  If you do not have a real audio player, go to <a target="_top"

<h3>Music in progress</h3>

<p>
  These are songs I have worked on over the last months.  A few are
  Robert Calvert covers, which, when finished and accompanied by their
  companion Calvert covers, will be compiled as a sort of "tribute".
  Tony and I have been dreaming about/working on this for quite some
  time.<br>Please send comments and critiques to me.
</p>

<h4><a href="aural_goop/se.ra">Sweet Entropy</a> (excerpt)</h4>
<p>
  This is quite experimental and incomplete (as well as rather defunct
  at this point).  It was originally going to incorporate all of the
  lyrics which are <em>Sweet Entropy</em>, but so far has only
  included a few lines.  Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately since i
  am the one doing the singing), the lyrical part is not included here
  as it is rather rough.
</p>

<h4>She Ain't Rappaport</h4>
<p>
  Tony sent me the lyrics to this and i wrote music.  No actual
  version with vocals is extant, however, at this point.  You can,
  though, listen to <a href="aural_goop/sarverse.ra">this</a>
  meandering instrumental thing which is a <em>sketch</em> of the
  verse and chorus.  The fuzzy guitar part is the actual melody line
  suited for the verse, so, if you like, you can whip out the lyrics
  and sing along.  Just for the general loopiness of it, I have also
  <a href="aural_goop/sarbass.ra">here</a> a proposed bassline for the
  entertaining instrumental of the song.
</p>

<h4><a href="aural_goop/bnw.ra">Brave New World</a></h4>
<p>
  This is simply a dual guitar part encompassing the first verse and
  chorus.  I suppose that would make it a power ballad.  Tony is going
  to eventually do the vox.
</p>

<h4><a href="aural_goop/rrm.ra">The Rah Rah Man</a></h4>
<p>
  This Calvert tune is mostly complete.  It needs the thud of
  skullwarper, I believe.  If you listen carefully, you may hear the
  mating call of a yak somewhere in the song's midst.  Those silly yaks.
</p>

<h4><a href="aural_goop/atmaq.ra">All the Machines are Quiet</a></h4>
<p>
  Okay, so I added quite a bit to this song.  You would, too, if you
  had insomnia for a week.  That last instrumental is based on a whole
  tone scale in A.  Quite a bit of this song is incomplete.

<h3>Falling Stars on Sunny Days</h3>

<p>
  The first Alfred compilation is now complete and being burned onto
  happy little digital discs.  It is to be the first of many (the
  second has already been planned out and partially digitized).  If
  you want a copy of the actual disc, send me mail at <a
  href="mailto:polaris@picard.tamu.edu">polaris@picard.tamu.edu</a>
  and I will provide you with one.<br>

  This is the track listing of the CD:
  <ul>
    <li>Lumpy as a Baby's Buttocks
    <li><a href="aural_goop/ctroad.ra">Cutting the Reins of a Dream</a>
    <li>Shards
    <li>The Whispering Man
    <li>A Melancholy Opulance
    <li><a href="aural_goop/ahosal.ra">A House of Strength and Love</a>
    <li><a href="aural_goop/dws.ra">Darin's Wedding Song</a>
    <li>Andrea's Song
    <li>Heart and Soul
    <li>Friends That Blow Up Places
    <li>In the Eye of Solitude
    <li><a href="aural_goop/tptef.ra">2 + 2 = 5</a>

    <li><a href="aural_goop/samg.ra">She Ain't My Girl</a>

  </ul>
  The CD enjoys performances by the likes of myself, Tony, Jayson,
  Raun, Shane, Acy, John, Lee, Chris and Roger.  It is big fun to play
  very loudly in the midst of almost any celebratory occasion except
  for (possibly) hanukkah.
