This section should possibly be expanded to a great degree.
Any ideas are very welcome (except from Loyal).<p>
<dl>
<dt>A <a href="/cgi-bin/user/polaris/thurk_itemize.pl/quote">list</a> of quote contributors.
<dd>This SHOULD give you a neat, spiffy li'l list of everyone who was
been immortalized in the Quotebook and SHOULD provide you with means
of accessing each listee's quotes.  Neat, eh?

I'm sure I'll eventually get around to including spiffy graphics and
superior text formatting as soon as I get a graphical client and make
all of the cgi scripts run buglessly, respectively.<p>
Give lots of comments!  Either email me or leave anonymous obiter dictum
below.  I shall conclude with a passage from <em>The Qur'an</em>:
<blockquote>On that day, We shall ask Hell:  "Are you full?"  And Hell will
answer:  "Are there any more?"<br>--<em>Qaf</em> <i>50:32</i>.</blockquote>
