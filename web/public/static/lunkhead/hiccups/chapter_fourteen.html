<h2>(10/22/1994)</h2>

A theme from "<i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>" that I found especially
alluring was the concept of a person becoming "institutionalized."
The sense in which this word was initially used was this:<p>
A man is convicted of a crime at a rather young age (young being
between twenty and thirty), and imprisoned.  He spends fifty years of
his life inside a world that is controlled in a perfectly measured
way, giving him no way of knowing how to act if he is suddenly shoved
into "reality"  -- reality being the world <i>outside</i> of prison.
I shall draw an analogy which happens to also draw an analogy between
this otherwise independent discussion and previous pages.<p>
--A score of music begins in the key of D.  Now, taking the ideas
which were dabbled with earlier (in the journal) and Bach's XXYY
nigh-cliche, this tone center of "D" may easily wander to A, the
dominant.  The listener "pushes" the "D" onto his/her mental stack and
enjoys the current tone center of A knowing full well (as most
listeners of music surely consciously do) the piece shall soon return
to D.  So it doesn't, though.  The A holds fast for, say... 9/10 of
the suite... long enough for Mr. Musical to get quite lost in it.  "A"
is all there is until, suddenly, for the last three bars of the
piece... there is D again!  Well!  We didn't expect that, now, did we?
Should the composer have included these final few measures or were
they purely "incidental"?<p>
Let us try another level.  What if, after playing around in A for
quite a time, the new dominant, E, is introduced and then clearly made
the tone center?  What of this?  The listening guinea pig puts the A
away for another day, or at least until Mr. "E" has lost his sway.
Again, though, as you (the surely quite omniscient reader) probably
figured, the gayly funster of a composer lets E whirl and twirl
through its own musical maelstrom for such a time that it would seem
odd to reintroduce the A, and by quite an act of outward heresy to
drop two full semi-tones to D!<p>
--In a technologicesque methodology, it becomes an act of recursive
enumeration.  Not recursion as in something calling itself, but
recursion in the sense of one thing spawning other similar things that
are built upon itself. --<br>

<br>
The piece of music may sound more sensible to, after all of the
meandering and longetivity after each, resolve to the tonic in which
it spent the longest time, in this case, E.  (I did stick a "B" in
there, I realize, but this simply illustrated a recoverable (or, shall
I say "sensibly recoverable") modulation.)<p>
He ends up killing himself for lack of comprehension of the world he,
indeed, came from but no longer can understand.  Might he have been
better off, or "happier"., or would it have been more "sensible", to
live out his days in prison?<p>
--But.  What of those who become "institutionalized" in a more
abstract sense?  What of the man who seeps deep into a religion, lets
his only life be a job as a teacher in a Christian School and
involvement in  church activities?  Isn't this person, too,
"institutionalized"?  Is he not oblivious to the <i>reality</i> beyond
the <i>walls</i> he has found  for himself?  Does every person, to an
extent, find their own personal prison, their own fortress that
shields them from the outside world?  Should these people ... should
all people ... be awakened in a analogous manner as the old man in
"The Shawshank Redemption," after spending <i>FIFTY</i> years of his
life in prison, was?  How about those that have walls within walls?
What could it take to regain the tonic?  Or, in fact, is the tonic
worth regaining?<p>
One might ask if there is a wall that can surround that anyone can
find that is the "correct" wall, as most religious think of their
imprisoning fortress.  Is, then, the hypothetical "LEAP OF FAITH" a
bound over the enclosure and into this NIRVANA?<p>
Have I gallivanted in a rambling sort of way from the specific to the
vague?  Hell, yeah!<p>

<h2>(10/23/1994) (Sunday ... roundup Sunday to be specific.)</h2>

Thought for the day:<br>
"If anyone thinks that God will not give victory to His apostle in
this world and in the world to come, let him tie a rope to the ceiling
of his house and hang himself.  Then let him ponder if his cunning has
done away with that which has enraged him."  --The Holy Qur'an
22:15<p>
* Is metaphor, allegory creation in itself or just very carefully
disguised plagiarism? *<p>
NEXT UNRELATED IDEA, PLEASE!<br>
Egads!  I have come upon an interesting notion that i shall attempt to
distill into a (more) concise concept.  Further reading in "Godel,
Escher, Bach" has unearthed a view on meaning that is bizarre to expand
into a new context.  Meaning:  is it inherent in an object itself, or
is it derived from the object's environment, including, of course,
its onlookers?  It is silly to say that each and every extant object
is of exactly one of these natures of meaning, since it is hopelessly
obvious that most "things" have meaning because of a combination of
the two.  For example, a pencil derives meaning for itself from itself
by the elements of which it is made and by the shape in which it
exists.  It is made of graphite wrapped in wood, tapered to a point on
one and and bearing a spiffy eraser (anti-pencil?) on the other.<p>
<i>AND</i>: the pencil derives meaning from its "context" by the way
it is employed (or by the way it is passively oriented in space:  one
could impale one's foot on it accidentally).  The "writing utensil"
employment is possibly one of the most often used contexts, though a
pencil could easily become a weapon or piece of an artistic
melange.<p>
"Godel, Escher, Bach" takes this idea and asks the questions:  Is DNA
compete in itself, a complex code that can create an organism, or,
more specifically, <i>HAS THE ABILITY</i> to create an organism devoid
of any specific chemical context?  Can all of the information dealing
with the transformation from DNA to organism be found (upon whatever
extensive research is needed) in the DNA itself?  Using only a
molecule and human intellect?<p>
OR -- is the DNA incomplete without its chemical environment that
spawns proteins, replication, gradual cell differentiation, etcetera;
incomplete in the sense that it, in itself, does not possess <i>THE
INFORMATION</i> to see the epigenesis from molecule to organism?<p>
--This genetics discourse led me to ponder on a translation of this to
the context of human personality.  It seems quite obvious to me that
the initial human being (meaning a human upon birth) has a devastating
dearth of "things" that will form its personality.  Or does it?  I
once read of a theory which is closely bounded to reincarnation.  A
human being has all of the knowledge that he will ever possess hidden
in his mind, waiting to be unlocked.  This would imply (quite
blatantly) that a person's <i>meaning</i> is completely defined by
his/herself and all the information necessary for his/her lifetime is
contained in the mind initially.<p>
The numerous obvious loopholes in this theory literally pounce from
the page, though, and one might be left with the impression that Bob
is a daft couch potato in need of a new toy.  I, who happen to be Bob,
refuse to toss such a theory away so readily.  Dampened and padded,
this concept (referred to by me as "APERCU") may hold a sagacious,
contemplative idea:<br>
<br>
IMAGE<br>
<br>
Intellect is somewhat passed from parents to child via DNA.  Physical
features are taken from parents' DNA.  Balding... sickle cell
anemia... average eyesight throughout a lifetime.... on and on.<p>
So, can there, could there, might there, is there... any knowledge
passed from parent to child by DNA?  For sure a capacity for
knowledge, but now about limits to what <i>KIND</i> of knowledge a
person can learn?  Is that plausible?  Might mutations expand or
contract at random?  This all ties to the human mind being
incomplete... not having the ability -- the FULL ability -- to realize
its meaning without environmental context.  But <i>HOW</i> incomplete?
 What does one know (how much meaning -- <i>self</i> meaning) without
context?<p>
Also, to conclude these jumbled conceptions....<br>
What does it mean to realize one's meaning?  Most things don't have
this particular problem.  Example -- a pencil has no ability to
realize its meaning, no matter its construct (this is possibly only
(of course) if the pencil's makeup stays within the bounds of the
typical definition of "pencil").  Once could tie in numerous religious
implications to this question, and, as a matter of fact, this question
may be at the heart of many religions.  I shall not draw any more
conclusions at this time.<p>
