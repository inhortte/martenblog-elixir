Words for the day
--terse:
  smooth, elegant and polished.
  concise -- devoid of excess.
</pre>
After hearing the annoyingly superfluous speech on rabid kneebiters,
Helen delivered a terse and pointed three word critique:  "Bite my
Pygamas!"<p>
<pre>
--aleatoric:
  chaotic in character.
  random or improvised.
</pre>
When Fred finally lost his footing on the ice, he performed a short
aleatoric dance consisting of whirling arms, bizarre and
unconventionally leg lifting gesticulations, and a torsal gyration
which would have made M. L. Retton gawk in awe before flopping face first
onto the frozen lake.<p>
<pre>
--convolute:
  twisted, involved or intricate.
</pre>
Marion reached through the convoluted tangle of wiring only to be
bitten by Morris the apprentice gardener.<p>

Synonyms for the day:
--SCRUTINIZE       In my only slightly aleatoric mailings
  SCAN             to Jayson of late, I am having to 
  INSPECT          painstakingly analyze my thoughts on
  EXAMINE--        many matters.  These words help clarify
                   such an analysis.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Scrutinize, the most particular of these four words, stresses
close attention to detail.  Scrutinizing your own thoughts involves
getting to the very seeds of why you hold an idea formed from any
particular idea and oftentimes rehybridizing the whole resulting tree
of concepts.
<li>Scan is a vague word, or, more precisely, a general word.  General,
though, only in the sense of its results when put to realistic use.
Scanning anything only gives you an overall, often superficial notion
of its meaning.
<li>Inspect is  an error detection verb.  That is the best definition
I can muster.  It is, however, quite accurate.
<li>Examination of an object is the (sometimes) extensive scrutiny to
reveal that object's nature, so as to not get just a notion, but an
overall idea of its inner workings.

Editor's note: though red can be an appealing colour, it is not in
what I would love to read scrawlings on a bright page such as this.
The morrow will find a clearer mind and a better writing implement.<p>

<h2>(10/25/1994)</h2>

I eagerly grasp at my intention to slip from productive pursuits to
lethargy with hands that mean to strangle... I'm grappling with my
will to get back to writing from the more alluring computer work that
has filled my day.  I sit pretentiously in Linear Algebra class
filling this page with rhetorical dribble.  I'll pass an integral form
of my psyche onto my surroundings just right after my left armpit
develops the ability to, at will, create a different recipe for
tapioka pudding thrice an hour.  At least I have found my bitchin'
pen.<p>
Further elaborating, actually -- what is the point to writing if you
have nothing to write about?  To hone your skills?  To entertain
yourself at a later date with easy, virtually idea-less writing?  Yup
Yup...<p>
The anchor must come free.  Um, after class.<p>

<h2>(10/26/1994)</h2>

Thoughts on "self-preservation":<br>
Many human "goals" can be stretched, expounded on, then compressed
back to the concept called 'self-preservation'.  Is this extremely
simple yet powerful instinctive sense an integral part of most
everything we do?<p>
Jayson provides a few excellent examples, though I shall not elaborate
exquisitely upon them.  Simply:  the avoidance of large, hairy beasts
with sharp claws and pointed teeth.  I suppose this may be a purer,
unadulterated... or better yet, non-camouflaged instance of
self-preservation than most which we experience.<p>
My linear algebra professor, dubbed "Dr. Wilson", makes an amusing and
thought provoking comment occasionally which is on these lines:
"Once I was like you:  my purpose was to graduate [college] and eat."
Is the lengthy struggle to get an education so one can attain a good
enough job to provide for oneself simple an extension of
self-preservation?  In a historical perspective, the <i>norm</i> was
once not to go to such lengths for an education because it was not as
difficult to provide for oneself without an elaborate series of
pre-planned educational curricula as it may be in this, the
"information", age.  I used the word "<i>norm</i>".  I meant this:
The <i>norm</i>al person chose the easiest path throughout history to
the end of self preservation.  Mayhaps at one point, in archaic times,
all that was needed was a good spear, careful (practiced) aim and a
mediocre to good throwing arm plus some meager cooking abilities.  The
only "education" relevant was learning the ability to kill meat that
could be eaten (and possibly sort out non-poisonous from poisonous
fruits, berries, etc)  and preparing that meant for a tasty eating
process.  As history progressed (as history surely does), or
"lengthened" with time, man created a more complex society, one that
allowed groups of different people to have different means that reached
the end of "self-preservation".  These groups split into more and more
until there were many different archetypes that all traced an
exceedingly convoluted course to the same goal -- to "eat".  So, the
"easiest" course that the <i>norm</i>al person could take became more
complex with time, resulting in an educational hierarchy (or a "manual
labor hierarchy") that allowed the normal person to find one of the
many means (his or her choice) to reach the goal... the only
goal... "to eat"... to survive.  Self preservation.  What of the
"un-<i>norm</i>al" ones?  Human intellect prospered in many, allowing
them to find ways around the <i>norm</i>al ways to "eat" (take a
thief, for example) AND to explore other pursuits outside the realm of
the instinctual "self-preserving" rule.<p>
So this sketchy idea I have presented is surely full of holes that may
or may not be easily patched, but no matter, it is surely food for
more thought on the matter.<p>
The point of the first draft of such an idea?<p>
---> The NORMAL person leads a life in whatever "intellectual"
pursuit they have close-- which is, in reality, just an elaborate
camouflage of the self-preservation instinct.  Conclusion?  Most people
really do not grow intellectually beyond their inborn instincts.<p>
A better way to state this might be...<br>
They do not explore intellectually beyond that which leads them to the
predetermined goal:  "to survive".  One could speculate, however, as
to what other instincts (if dissimilar instincts do, indeed, exist_
drive any other sort of intellectual diversity that my extend beyond
that which can be traced back to the self-preservation base.  If every
mental endevour can be traced back to a foundation of instinctual
behavior, it might be easy to come to the conclusion that intelligence
or creativity, even is just a aftereffect of heredity.  This may be a
silly conclusion, though.<p>
--What of the need to find "meaning", then?  What of this need that
drives some to seek walls to enclose them, urges others to break them
down, and pushes still others to self-destruction?  What primal force
could, if any, this be distilled to?  Or is <i>this</i> one of the
elements that truly separates us from instinctual creatures?  And
might this, too, if that, be whittled down to a hereditary factor --
the non-instinctive instinct.  "The primal urge to question the
validity of primal urges."<p>
--Does a man who submits himself utterly to an ideology do so for
sense of security?  Surely he does.  But security from what?  Perhaps
from harm... therefore a spawn of the "self-preservation" base, but I
think not.  the closest idea I have at present is that this man is
seeking (and has found) security from unsanity.  Unsanity!  "Chaos",
big and evil, lurking behind self-imposed prison walls... he wishes to
become "institutionalized", for that is the way of the happy?
Escapism comes in many forms, religion (whether true or not) can be one
of them.  Reading fiction perpetually could be another.  The
possibilities are endless, some safer than others -- some with more
security from the unsane, others just passing solace from the
dangerous outside.  This security is purely anti-intellectual.  It
prohibits all consideration of the world outside and sometimes even the
knowledge of it.  It becomes simpler, easier to live with a feeling of
non-danger, non "sudden shifting of environment", and occasionally
even total refrain from change.  So, the question remains still from
the bygone Shawshank ponderings:  Is it "right" to awaken these people
-- crash through their walls into where they are seemingly safe from
knowledge__ safe from thought?  Or should they be left to live and
die where they can manage best?<p>
--Lee once said:  "Religion is just an excuse to not think for
yourself."  This statement, though I find much untruth in it, hold
much relevance to my former discourse.  <i>RELIGION</i>, I NOW know,
after years of rejecting it, has many features, uses and
intellectuality behind it and is just recently becoming a prevalent
interest in my life.  So, I shall change the quote of Lee's by only
one word:<br>
"Escapism is just an excuse to not think for yourself."<p>
Now I consider it correct in whole.  Religion <i>CAN</i> be an
escapist tactic, when twisted, as can many, many things, as I
mentioned on the previous page.  This is possibly the aspect of
religion that Lee was observing (or not more "the aspect of religion,"
but "the way some use religion") when he made this statement.<p>
To correlate, I suspect that escapism, coupled with the drive of
"self-preservation" creates a more fluid world to survive in, and that
is a frequent tactic of the <i>norm</i>al person -- to use escapism to
help focus their life on the goal "to eat" and not be disturbed by the
evil outside.<p>
--One more note on escapism:<br>
Is it an instinctual drive to eliminate departure from instinct?  Is
it the drive to adhere only to primal desires?  This seems very
contradictory but at the same time insightful to me.<br>
I shall ponder.<p>

<h2>(10/27/1994)</h2>
One the same note:  is "superficiality", "cursoriness" and the like a
sort of escapism?  Or a means to simplify?  Or something to "believe
in"?  These could be "and/or's" as well as "or's."<p>
