Having thoughts about yesterday's musical explorations, I find a
quaint lack of sagacious mental prowess.  In fact, I consider my
musings quite daft.  To rationalize a bit, though (in two ways), this
journal, in itself, is a route for self-exploration and reconsidering
past ventures is part of the purpose.  Also, there is something to be
said about arriving at long known concepts yourself.  It is this:<br>
A sense of accomplishment?  Mayhaps.<p>
--Consider my music summation once again.  I shall modify the
procedure:
<pre>
* PROCEDURE STACK(MELODY)
    { FOR(I=LENGTH(MELODY);I>0;I--)
        { NEW = NEW*(SUBM(MELODY)*(LENGTH(MELODY)-I+1)) }
      RETURN(SUBM(NEW))) }
</pre>
--SUBM takes the melody and returns part of it (starting with the
initial note and ending with i ... or with the length in the case of
its last call).<br>
Multiplication by a scalar is as multiple additions.<br>
Multiplication of two melodies stack them on top of one another.  My
description seems obviously lacking a point, I see, so, to be brief in
conclusion (as I have grown weary of incoherence and misunderstanding
of my own semi-conclusions), I will say that this stacking creates a
<i>canon</i>:  like such ......<br>

I am sure this exhibits several mathematical properties that my simple
mind cannot perceive at this instant...<br>
When am I going to get to the good stuff?  The stuff that half the
world hasn't already conceived?  Bleh.<p>
