<h2>(10/27/1994)</h2>

I am a man with the big ideas<br>
This is how it seems<br>
But seeming, my darling<br>
That is the stitch in this veil<br>
That separates you and me.<br>
We were on that bus<br>
On its way to paradise<br>
We drove too slowly, the curtain closed<br>
No one saw the end of that show.<br>
Read my book which has no end.<br>
