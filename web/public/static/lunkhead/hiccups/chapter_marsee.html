<h3>Chapter Marsee</h3>
<h3>By Bob Shelton</h3>

<h4>(10/31/1994)</h4>

Frustration -- pounding my brain with its painful pickaxe, driving all
rationality form my head.  I can't think!  I cannot think!  Try as I
might, I am feeble.  The shadows creep quickly over my eyes, blurring
my sight and smothering my mind.  Fuzzy images of clearer thoughts
dance just within reach.  I grapple with them to try to untangle the
weave that squeezes tighter and tighter onto my brow.  Limping, I
grunt unintelligible, ugly remarks at passers-by, blinking at my
arrogance, lost in their opulence.  Memorizing names of cities and
spaces on maps, places to dance and scream your revelation into empty
air, only to hear the echoes years later without the meek applause.<p>
Problems... things are created to solve problems.  Frustration is
prominent when you cannot formulate these problems into terms
comprehendable to the end of a snazzy solution.

--I press my face against the glass of my unbelief, the foggy pane
clears and I see lucid emotions, wheeling wearily through my mind.
Have I lost all sense of who I have been?  Have these things that have
tortured and rended my spirit been subdued, leaving me bored with my
contentment?<p> 
Have I slacked off in my writing?  Yes!<p>

<h4>(11/2/1994) (Marcie's Birthday -- XVI).</h4>

--Psalms 23.  (NIV)<br>
[The lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.]:<br>
The Lord God has buit a fence, a fence of barbs and electrons, tearing
and electrocuting all evil that tries to trespass.  I need not
anythinge else, for the lord is my <i>tender</i>.  Sheep are, a bit,
like humans, a bit unpredictable and bizarre, unruly upon occasion for
no particular reason, illogical.  This confused mass cannot manage on
its (their) own, so a shepherd (the Lord) tends them.  It is a
beautiful and meaningful relationship.  Very binding... in a quirky
sort of way.  The shepherd is not needy, but stil cares for his flock,
which is needy and lost on its (their) own.<p>
[he makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet
waters]:<br>
The Lord allows his sheep to lie, restful from a chaotic livelihood
(oh! the entropic life of a sheep!), and leads his flock to waters for
refreshment.  Sustenece and rest are two of the most coherent branches
that lead to "self-preservation."  It seems God frovides for these
freely and plentifully.<p>
[he restores my soul.  He guides me in paths of rightousness for his
name's sake.]:<br>
The soul__ also called the mind in so many ancient texts.  these two
words are so interchangable, even having the same translation in
Aramaic and Hebrew.  Frustration, anger, pain, any other degredative
emotion of the mind is clensed.  The Lord restores the soul/mind,
bringing peace.  FOR HIS <i>NAME</i>'S SAKE, God guides his flock on
to the path of rightiousness, the path of good__ His path.  If he did
not do so, his reputation would be in ruin.  Who would believe in a
God who does not hold the promises He makes?  The paths of
rightiousness are within reach following the shepherd who, because it
would be hypocracy not to, tends his flocks with care.<p>
[Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death]<br>
[I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and staff -- ]<br>
[they comfort me]:<br>
These are metaphorical, or, symbolic, linies of teh psalm.  As stated
earlier, the lord has a fenced pasture for his sheep, who are
protected from the evils, the physical dangers, of the world.<p>
The pensive sheep wanders, though, in his mind, upon occasion, through
the "valley" of despair, sickness, psychological evil.  The closer one
strays to these darkensses, the deeper in the shadow they can be... a
feeble sheep in mental anguish, mayhaps from lost love, dead friends,
or faulty footing has the road and staff hovering to drive those freas
far from his mind.  Turn to the Shepherd, and comfort shall be found.
It is, because of this, possible to deny the murky black of evil and
stare it in its pocked face until it melts to nothing withte Lord
God's Rod and Staff overhead, protecting.<p>
Do not stray from the pasture!  The psychological darkness is evil
enough!<p>
[You prepare a table before me in the presense of my enemies.
You]<br>
[anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.]<br>
The Shepherd stands before his sheep, a sheep ful of pain and
frustration, I THE PRESENSE OF THESE ENEMIES, these psychological
apparitions of hatred and fear, and load the table with sustinece
divine.  Your enemies shall be vanquished by God's compassion.<p>
[Surely goodness and love will follow me all the dys of my life,]<br>
[and I will dwell in the house of the Lord -forever-.]<br>
Thus church ended...

Word for the day:
--Aphorism:
  A concise statement about a principle.
</pre>
An aphorism about matrx multiplication might go like this:  Matrix
multiplication, unlike the multiplication of real numbers, is not
commnative.  Or, an aphorism concerning soap might be:  Don't rub soap
in your puppie's eyes lest it go blind.<p>
A BIG RODENT...      [arabic phrase]<br>
No, actually -- <i>THE</i> big rodent.  Just a touch of arabic to
brighten the night.  A thought I was speculating upon last night went
somehow similar to this:<br>
(by the way -- <i>A</i> big rodent would be [arabic phrase].)<br>
Thoughts, as you grow, ideas and concepts, virtues, vices and desires
waft at first simply, then with a greater and greater entropy..  These
"emotions" reach a point of nigh-uncontrollability, possibly early in
the adolescent years.  There are so many teens who are rebellious --
the ydon't think parents, school, whaterver is fair.  They are going
"crazy".  CRAZY!  It is just the jumble of emotions, careening and
whirling through the young mind, causing a lashing out at order
around.  Blame is easily placed, but the sources are very hard to
find.  Ficklesness is prominent.  Emotions vascillating like a hanky
in the wind unteach any logical thought.  Finally,  this "phase" (as
many might dub it), passes to an extent and certain emotional ruts are
tread, with only minor, occasional upheaval.<p>
A popular notion is that all of this chaos, and then, eventually,
"mmoderated" EMOTIVE ENERGY cannot be actually controlled by its
effectee, but is, instead, subject to soem phantom power call
"moods".<br>
I'm not in the mood to do this...<br>
I'm not in the mood to do that...<br>
blah blah blather...<br>
It is my humble opinion that these chaos of emotions, these placid
seas of sameness, can be grappled and molded into productive
energy. Bah on the bastards who think they are controlled by moods!
Moods are, in fact, just emotions that shape the whole emotional state
of a person (meta-emotions?), and feelings, as we all know, are just
chemical responses in the brain triggered from similar circumstances
to past experiences erupting the same.  Build!  Build!  Build!  And
finally, as the mind has so many referencs to certain "feelings", it
can pick from the dominant ones more and mroe as life progresses,
giving a few cycling "moods".  Chemical brain spooge can be countered
very efficiently with other chemical brain spooge.  Just hammer the
malleable emotions that shape you into a drving force.  Use them!
(see 'psychoderelict')... I believe this is possible with more ease
than most choose to admit.  After all, it's easier to just ride the
rapids then fight them, but, eventually, a calm stream of non-moving
water is where you end up.

<h4>(11/4/1994)</h4>

An odd singing fills the room, the men on the unrolled carpet finally
sit to the eerie following silence.  Some then bend and press their
foreheads to the ground, again ain silence, strangely focused,
barefooted and clean.  They seem perfectly fit, alluring in their
ways, praying to an unseen entity, obviously the center of their every
intention.  More come through the door behind me; all are silent, they
oblivious to newcomers, and to me.  The "ceremony" continues, mute in
sound but rich in unseen emotion.  A young muslim approaches the
microphone and sings a melody sweet and enigmatic in a language I
guess as Arabic.  The only word I recognize sounds similar to
"Mohammud", though I know he is not the focus of their worship.  He
stops singing and the leader, at a pulpit, begins.  I recognize no
words, and, having only been a student of Arabic for a week, do not
find this surprising.  Everyone is attentive, without exception.<p>
The "sermon" begins.  Islam should be spread to the corners of the
earth, and it is the purpose of these muslims to do so.<p>
Religion is like a tree, much as education, that builds upon itself
and just as the things you learn in high school are not discarted in
college, and those not discarded in the workplace, so religion builds
upon itself and has from the beginning.  Each propht has succeeded the
one before by adding to the things tought by his precedessor.  Muslims
believe that Mohammud tied the loose ends that Jesus had begun
spinning and gave, from God, the Qur'an, which is a message for
all.<p>
As the sermon concludes, the leader again sings an enigmatic tune in
Arabic.  Interesting and alluring it is, and quite far from being
daft.  Everyone rises on cue and stands in two rows in front of the
pulpit.  Another, whom I cannot see, begins singing then ceases
again as suddenly as he began; then another starts and all join for
one word upon occasion.... an "Amen"?  Or the Islamic equivalent?<p>
I woner what these drifting words (acapella) sung through the thick
air mean.  I wish I could catch them... to compare to the silly hmns
of the Baptists.  All bow in unison, then kneel, foreheads pressed,
all in time, to the floor.  A worship practtice that includes
excercise seems quite practical, actually, even convincing to an
extent.  This needs much analysis before I can reach any lasting
conclusion, for I shall vascillate if I pass any immediate
judgement.<p>
Discipline is a prominent factor in this service:  Discipline and
arobics, I see, as they bow, kneel, again.  And an aura of intellect
is somewhat cast by all I spoke to before the mosque attendence, as
though each had not just accepted, but thought carefully about their
faith, about their devotion, about its ties to every aspect of worldly
life.<p>
There is more silent prayer, each muslim seemingly in close contact to
whom each worships.  It looks very much more personal, thoughtful,
than the mindless "Amen!"  "Amen!"  "Amen!" I hear men affirming
throughout a baptist sermon, as if only the preacher actually believes
what he is saying and the congregation is willing to accept no matter
what, mindlessly shouting "Amen" at intervals.<p>
Islam is <i>VERY</i> different, but... oddly built upon the same.<p>
God.<p>
<hr>
--Qur'an 12:54:<br>
[Joseph is speaking, or, rather, being quoted]
<blockquote>"And I do not hold my own self to be free from weakness;
for, the soul is surely prone to enjoin evil, save that whereon my
Lord has mercy.  Surely my Lord is Most Forgiving,
Merciful."</blockquote>
At first glance, this meant to me that God is the only way away from
evil, from the natural tendency of the soul (or mind, as I have
already discussed) to drift towards evil, but, upon further pondering,
I get this from it:<p>
Joseph says h is absolutely <i>NOT</i> free of weakness because the
soul is, NATURALLLY, prone to do evil, or think evil... "enjoin evil"
is a bad translation.  The arabicword means more "incite", meaning to
stir up or spur on.  But the Lord has mercy on these lapses.  These
driftings into badness is the NATURAL, or animal-like state of man.
When controlled, grappled and moulded, a man reaches the MORAL
state.<p>
--Qur'an 75:3:<br>
"And I do call to witness the self-accusing soul, that the day of
Judgement is a certainty."<p>
Again, at first glance the wording of this confused me.  God seemsed
to be patronizing the self-accusing soul, saying jedgement day will
whack it on the head giving it realization.  But, upon further
scrutinization, the self-accusin soul is called to witness, much as a
witness is called to the witness stand to testify in a courtroom, and
shall give its proof that the day of judgement is, indeed, coming.  I
included this verse because "the self-accusing soul" ties in with a
man's MORAL state.  One cannot maintain this state unless, upon
occasional drifting from it, one reproves oneself for the sidestep
from one's moral structure.  So, this, too, is part of rational,
intellectual thought that raises men from animals.<p>
--Qur'an 89:28-31:<br>
"And thou, O soul at peace!  Return to thy Lord well pleased with Him
and he well pleased with thee.  So enter thou among my chosen
servents, and enter thou My Garden."<p>

The "soul at peace," to me, refers to a man who has achieved his moral
state of being, empty of the evil, torments and fears of natural
life.  It says, earlier in that chapter:<br>
"Verily, he <i>truly</i> prospers who purifies himself..."<br>
and goes on to talk of the herafter being more lasting and better than
life on earth, which leads me to an intersting diversion of thought:
It is true that people are, in general, most comfortable with what
they are "used to," what thtey have always lived, seen, etc.  So,
since men have ONLY seen this life on earth, it is possibly common to
prefer it to some unseen "afterlife" -- a "live for the moment"
attitude, if you will, is what most subscribe to, quelling any tue
thought of an "afterlife", though some may claim to believe.  Maybe
the Qur'an asks men to use their intellects to realize that they can
hold a future of change up to the present, compare, and see that
living for the Hereafter is preferable, in the long run, to transient
life.<p>
Anyhow... the "soul at peace" flows towards god much like a river
flows the direction in which gravity pulls it, or a ock falls staight
down, as if it was its destiny.  The soul at peace is a product of the
MORAL state of man.<p>
-- The soul is to the human body as fire is to flint. --<p>
It cold be said that physical actions affect the soul/mind and vice
versa.  Even to the point of the things you eat, words you speak, way
you walk, etc... an interesting observation.<p>
This surely accounts for all the rules in the Qur'an about such
things.<p>

<h4>(11/5/1994)</h4>

* in the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful<br>
* have we not opened for thee thy bosom<br>
* and removed frmo thee thy burden?<br>
God, by giving mankind a structure of moral standards, a way to let a
man's soul flow to its natural destination, God, has lifted the
"burden" of emotional chaos and fear, hurt and guilt.<br>
* which had well nigh broken thy back?<br>
* and we exhalted your name?<br>
These burdens, lifted by the gift of knowledge of how to attain a pure
soul, are enough to psychologically break one's back.  They are
gone, by the grace of God, and a muslim's name is held to high esteem,
in otherwords, he has a place in the Lord's Garden.<br>
* surely there is ease after hardship.<br>
* so when thou art free, strive hard,<br>
* and to thy Lord do then attend whole-heartedly.<br>
The ease is the peace, a gentle but direct flow of the soul to God.
When this peace is attained, repay the Lord with fervent service and
with utmost reverence.<p>

<h4>(11/6/1994)</h4>

--The problem with the Bible, or more, the way the Bible is taught to
Christians in America is a lack of real rational thought about it as a
whole.  It is commonly accepted that if a problem is found then it
should be dismissed because it is "God's Word" and therefore is
probably written that way for a reason.  If we can't figure that
reason out, we aren't grasping God's word well enough.  Why not look
at the Bible in a rational, logical way?  There is a section in the
old testament that claims David to be the eighth son of Jesse, then
later claims him to be the seventh.  An editor's error?  The product
of many editors over many years?  Take 1 Samuel 16:10-12 and 1
Chronicles 2:13-15.  The former passage claims David to be the eighth
son of Jesse, and the latter says he is the <i>7th</i> son.  Small
editing errors such as this, when passed on, over and over, sometimes
by word of mouth, through the generations of Jews  can multiply and
multiply, giving <i>me</i> the impression that, by using rational
thought, the old testament is not the word of God, but heresay that was
written by followers of God over many years.  The <i>ORIGINAL</i>
revelations, I believe, are (were) true at the time they were given to
prophets (such as Moses, in the case of the Torah) by God.  But, it is
obvious, just from, say, the last chapter in Deuteronomy, that the
original manuscripts by Moses or whomever scribed them in Moses' time,
were changed and edited over the generations.  How much of this is in
the Bible?  In the days of Nebechanezzar, the whole of the Torah,
among other Holy writings, were BURNED and Ezra, accompanied by five
scribes wrote it all again -- wrote <i>204 books</i>.  There are not
204 books in the old testament.  Um, lots was left out?  Smaller
divisions?  It's still obvious that Ezra  was an editor, and possibly
the cause of many of the contradictions (many of which I should show,
but shall, instead, go on to other topics and leave my speculations
and other torments until later).<p>
--There is much to think of on this matter.<p>

--Proverbs 22:6 is a verse used readily and exhaustively by many
Christian parents to force a certain lifestyle on their children.
Doug Bump is absolutely no exception.  The verse (KJV) reads:<br>
<blockquote>"Train up a child in the way he shold go; and when he is
old, he will not depart from it."</blockquote>
To many Christians, this verse means RAISE A CHILD right and your
child will STICK WITH IT.  So, in other words, enforce upon a child a
Christian lifestyle, and, taken to the extreme that Doug Bump has, do
not let that child stray, even in self-expresion.<p>
Now, I have seveal problems with this, and of course, I could bring up
many an argument on sociological and psychological grounds that could
probably refute Doug's standpoint as "brainwashing" and "ludicrous".
<i>But</i>, Doug will simply go to Proverbs 22:6 and claim he is doing
what God intended.  So, to trip up Doug's resolve, I shall look at the
issue solely from the point of view of the Bible.<p>
The word "Train" and possibly both "train" and "up", making the phrase
that they surely are, come from the Hebrew word [Hebrew word],
pronounced "khaw-nak'", he stress on the latter syllable.  This word
means "initiate" or "discipline" indicating, possibly, that Doug is
right so far, or as we will see, my claim is also valid.  In other
words, taking the first word out of context (and we'll see some more
about the concept of taking things out of context in a minute) leaves
the verse ambiguous.<p>
Initiate a child...<br>
The word "child" is from the Hebrew [Hebrew word] (nah'-ar), a boy or
girl between the age of infancy and adolescence.  Child, yes, is a
proper translation.  So, on to "way":  Way is translated from [Hebrew
word] (deh'-rek) which means a "road" on which one "trods".
Figuratively it indicates, much as the word "path" is used in english
(which path should I take at the fork...), a way of life.  So, our
verse now reads:<br>
"Initiate a child in the way of life..."<p>
He is easily added, but when one gets to the word "should", there is
problems -- BIG PROBLEMS.  The word "should" comes from nothing, that
is to say, it is <i>not found</i> in the original Hebrew.  It was made
up by whatever was in the translator's mind at the time, the way he
saw the verse or HIS INTERPRETATION.  So we shall leave out the word
"should".  The word "go" is a confusing one, being tranlated from
[Hebrew word] (peh), which means "the mouth", particularly "the mouth
used as a means of puffing or blowing."  I am assuming this is a
Hebrew idiom, and the fact that I am not literate in Hebrew or the
lifestyles of its culture, I have to scrutinize and then speculate.  I
can see one figurative outlook on the word, which is speech -- blowing
out of the mouth words.  I shall go with this one until the day comes
that holds better understanding.

<p>
So:<br>
<i>"Initiate (or discipline) a child in the way of life he
speak."</i><br>
Since verbs are commonly found near the ends of sentences in Arabic, a
language I AM familiar with, and basing this on its similarity to
Hebrew, I would think this phrase better reads as:<br>
<i>"Speak the discipline to a child in the way of life of him."</i><br>
Of course, this makes no sense, and since "he" is not found in the
hebrew text, either, only "child", we have:<br>
<i>"Initiate a child in the way of life (you) utter."</i><br>
Pronouns, I know, are very implied, but this makes much more sense to
me.  The difference is, though, that while the "He" is not found
anywhere, "You" is implied in the Hebrew with "initiate" (khaw-nak'),
and it suitibly follows that it should be also used with "Peh", lest
the sentence, more than it already is, becomes ambiguous.
</p>
<p>
Instead of tracing the Hebrew of the second half of the verse, I shall
go on to my other point.  As I mentioned a tad earlier, I now come
back to the concept of taking verses out of context.  The remainder of
Proverbs 22 (each verse) shares a common trait; that being they are
observations of human life.  Take a few for example:<br>
22:2 -> <i>"The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of
them all."</i><br>
22:8 -> <i>"He that soweth iniquity shall reap naity: and the rod of
his anger shall fail."</i><br>
22:9 -> <i>"He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he
giveth his bread to the poor."</i><br>
Basically, all of those verses tell of an action and a consequence.
The do not, per se, give instructions in the form of commandments, but
advice that if one thing is done, another wil lhappen.  If you apply
this to verse 6, the conclusion reached might be this:<br>
The way you train a child to be in his years from infancy to
adolescence is the way he shall live for the remainder of his life.
</p>
<p>
This is a simple aphorism, but the same can be said of most in this
chapter of Proverbs.  My point is this:  I feel that parents who take
this verse as meaning <i>"Train your child in the RIGHT way, so he
will not stray"</i> are misinterpreting the intention of the passage.
It is simply an observation that if one DOES train (initiate a way of
life) a child a certain way, he will usually stick with it, as verse
nine says someone gives bread to the poor has a "bountiful" eye,
therefore is blessed.
</p>
<p>
Proverbs -- observations of actions and consequences.<br>
</p>
<p>
My first discourse involving the manipulation of the verse using the
original Hebrew also, I believe, adheres to my sentiment, although it
also, because of <b>our</b> lack of knowledge of Hebrew idiom, proves
the ambiguity of this particular verse and the reason it is
interpreted in many different ways.
</p>

<h4>(11/7/1994)</h4>

<p>
My interest and waryness of Islam are increasing steadily at the same
pace.  It is, as the speaker at the lecture I attended this evening
stated, as simple on the exterior as the equation <i>"E = mc^2"</i>,
but as complex and full of wonder in its entirety as the theory of
reletivity.
</p>
<p>
In the opening verses to [arabic word], meaning <i>"the cow"</i>, a
glimpse of the reality that is Islam is revealed:<br>
<i>"This is a perfect book; there is no doubt in it; it is a guidence
for the righteous."</i><br>
Muslims believe the Qur'an came straight from God, no questions
asked.  Muhammed, God's prphet, recorded it all.  Therefore, in the
shoes of a Muslim, who absolutely holds the Qur'an as God's word, it
is perfect, with no doubt.  The Qur'an is a guide for all who follow
the path which is right, the path laid by God.  This book is
infallable, therefore, in its guidence.
</p>
<p>
It would seem useless, to me anyway , to try to convince a Muslim that
the Qur'an is full of crap, not saying that it is, but it is THE LAW
for the Muslim nation, which, as a matter of fact, is 1/5 of the
world's population.
</p>

<h4>(11/8/1994)</h4>
