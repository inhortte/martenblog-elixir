      <p>
I have arrived to my lonely but satisfactory hotel room from the <em>atrium</em>. It’s
more of a dining room than <em>atrium</em>, really, but it serves both purposes, so I
shall continue to call it <em>atrium</em>. In the <em>atrium</em> were victuals. I took them
in my furry paws and ravenously filled my gaping maw. It was, also,
satisfactory. I now sip a glass of red wine.</p>
<p>
The pain in my chest has receded. I only thought about possibilities briefly
before falling asleep last night. Surely, I could have died yesterday. The
vehicle slammed into the <em>jersey barrier</em> at approximately 45 mph. My parents
tell me again and again that I should thank the <strong>Lord</strong> for my survival, for
my health, for my lack of mangled limbs. I thank the seat belt and air bag,
instead. Yes, very mundane and unspiritual of me. Ah well. I am a <em>cunt</em>.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, such experiences are what I’ve read as <em>life changing events</em>. I
feel very little has changed besides the fact that I cannot propel myself
around in a large blunt object. Perhaps the whole <em>life flashing before one’s
eyes</em> and such is a media-made spectacle. Or pseudo-spectacle. Or
spectacle-to-be. Something of the sort. I am calm. There is no need to panic.</p>
<p>
The sense of displacement has also receded. My life is simply within another
transition. My whole life is a transition. Well, I am living within a
transition between transitions, then. A meta-transition. Soon (I use that term
loosely), I’ll be again in <em>Seminole</em>, where I shall resume routines that
always entrench me whilst there. I don’t mind. They spawn creativity. It is a
phase of narrow transition. I say <strong>narrow</strong> because the path of the transition
is quite one-dimensional. When one has routines, and usually strict ones, then
this is the case. Again, I don’t mind. It is, after all, only a transition.</p>
<p>
The next transition, one which is more wide and more full of the unknown, comes
afterwards.</p>
<p>
I chatted with Christian briefly on google+, outlining my experiences over the
last two days. The conclusion was this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
(08:11:34 PM) inhortte: I bought two jars of fresh honey in
nashville.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
(08:11:40 PM) inhortte: They were in the passengers’ seat.  </p>
