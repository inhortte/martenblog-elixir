I've successfully stuck with the minimalistic character of the piece that was evident in its inception as *AcyBob* and has carried itself through the parts and transformations therein. *Part V* contains a bastardization of the bastardization in *Part III* of the melody in...

    The backing of the part will be purely mellotron playing the chords two notes at a time, but not constantly! No no no! That would not be appropriate.

### The spice of this part will be **space**

And since I have been listening to quite a bit of **Space Music** the last few days, I'll make sure there are plenty of sweeps and gurgles accompanying the composed music. *Layered on top*, yes sir ee.

    The collusion of contrasting ideas concerning the fifth part of Cycle are now in concert. The result, in my mind, anyhow, will debauch the easy and hypnotic feeling established during the final ostinato of part four.

##### So the first concern is the transition.

I know that before I wrote that I would not write proper transitions but instead let the music suddenly stumble from one frame to another with no harmonic *warning* or set up. I feel this must be an exception to this so-called *rule* I created for...

This brings me back to 12 Snap. I may not have been an expert by the definition that many people have, but I was towering over most at that company in knowledge of the workings of the system. This is very much true of the so called managers, who, though some came from a technical background, were dollops of oozing slime beneath the iron of mine and Jenicek's prowess.

    The Hawkwind binge has begun. I'm four albums in if you count Hawklords. Specifically, I am listening to the live double I got at the oft frequented cd shop near Marienplatz in Munich. It is a live document of the tour supporting Choose Your Masques and reminds me greatly of April and May of 2000, especially living at the first hotel near Silberhornstrasse. I can still smell the oil I used for cooking in the tiny kitchen provided in my room in my mind. It was a scent which did not leave me or my clothing un...
