I have drunk so much green tea that I doubt very seriously if I could sleep even if I wished to do so.</p>
<p>
Things progress slowly in this lazy land. The days ooze lethargically from morning to night. They seem to echo each other, yet time still drags. Today was punctuated with one oddity. And a disturbing oddity it was. My parents took me out to the local cemetery to show me where my grandparents on my father’s side are buried. Surely I have been there before, but the wash of bleakness the graveyard presented piqued no recognition. There was a nagging similarity, however, to the one in Pecos in which a certain Lee Tarver rots. They then proceeded to show me the four empty plots they owned. Two for them. I suppose the other two are for myself and for my brother. That was never explicitly stated.</p>
<p>
It is wasting to be surrounded by old age and obvious mortality for stretches of time. Their aches and their peers’ pains are often the focal point of discussion. Repeated discussion. As much as I love my parents, Thursday will not come too soon.</p>

<p>
<strong>17.</strong> The only things I am materialistic about are my journals, some books, and objects concerned with music. Everything else is disposable/replaceable.</p>

<p>
<strong>28.</strong> The only thing I am truly afraid of is mortality (see #38).</p>
<p>
<strong>29.</strong> I dismiss native English speakers who regularly confuse their, they’re and there as a waste of sentience. I realise that this is a bad thing.</p>
<p>
<strong>30.</strong> I had my first real girlfriend when I was 22. She was 14.</p>
<p>
<strong>31.</strong> I can touch-type using both the qwerty and Dvořák keyboard layouts.</p>

<p>
<strong>45.</strong> I do not drink coffee.</p>

<strong>46.</strong> Once I felt that lyrics were very vital to my enjoyment of music. Now, except for a few exceptions, I don’t bother myself with them much.</p>
<p>
<strong>47.</strong> I am obsessive about showering every day.</p>
<p>
<strong>48.</strong> I am turned off by cultural pigeonholes.</p>
<p>
<strong>49.</strong> Ingrained traditions bother me.</p>
<p>
<strong>50.</strong> I’d rather eat broccoli florets than potato (or corn) chips.</p>
<p>
<strong>51.</strong> I was only a futbol (soccer) fan once – June 2004 in Portugal. Other than that, I have never followed team sports.</p>
<p>
<strong>52.</strong> Sports I do enjoy include biking, hiking and jogging.</p>

<p>
<strong>59.</strong> I shagged a prostitute (actually several).</p>
<p>
<strong>60.</strong> In the past, my online journal (primarily one which was sadly lost due to a harddisk crash) angered or alienated several people (women).</p>

<p>
<strong>69.</strong> I never want to live in the United States again in my life.</p>

<p>
<strong>72.</strong> I’ve gone five days without eating.</p>

<p>
<strong>84.</strong> I don’t answer questions that I perceive as rhetorical.</p>
<p>
<strong>85.</strong> I listen now to almost no music that I did when I was in high school and university.</p>
<p>
<strong>86.</strong> I often have dreams which are set in the town in which I grew up.</p>
<p>
<strong>87.</strong> I tend to write music which is too complicated for me to easily play.</p>
<p>
