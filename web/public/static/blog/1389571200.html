      <p>
Today’s special writing music is <em>Open</em> by <strong>The Necks</strong>. I am pretty sure that
my parents will interrupt me during the piece, as it is approximately one hour
long.</p>
<p>
Yesterday, I spent most of my productive time grinding my molars on the bones
of a Palm Civet. That is, I was getting authentication to function on the
previously named <em>Radiotracking</em> site. The new moniker is, of course, <em>Think
Like A Mink</em>. Though my <em>journal</em> is currently also hosted here, the main point
of purchasing the domain name was to have a stable place to host all things
related to <a href="http://lutreola.eu">Project Lutreola</a> and whatever I decide to call
Madis’s pursuits in the Ebro valley.</p>
<h4>
My fingernails are encrusted with blue.</h4>
<p>
I finally, after trying the <em>roll yer own</em> method and ember-auth, I went with
<a href="https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth">ember-simple-auth</a>, as it is
complient to openid hovno and I suspect I should have learned that standard (by
standard, I mean <em>hovno</em>) long ago. After allowing myself to be authenticated,
I pushed the repository and became lackadaisical for the remainder of the
evening. I even ate some potato chips. I purged afterwards.</p>
<p>
Today, I need to finally put together some sort of roles / permissions per
user. This moment is meant as a brainstorming session.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Users are associated with a project.  </li>
  <li>
Users can be associated with multiple projects.  </li>
  <li>
Projects are associated with organization.  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Tiit wrote the other day:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
YES, UNDER ONE ORGANIZATION SEVERAL PROJECTS. I WONDERS IS THERE SOME SORT
OF SITUATION WHEN TWO ORGANISATIONS ARE JOINTLY RUNNING A PROJECT, THEN ONE
IS LEAD-ORGANISATION.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If I go with this method, however, then my current hierarchy (though not fully
realized programmatically) will be reversed. Projects will be the peak carving
on the totem pole. Organizations will point to them. Users will be associated
with both, independently.</p>
<p>
<em>Ugh.</em></p>
<p>
Furthermore, animals could be associated with various projects. I don’t see as
much of a problem with achieving this, however. Right now, when an animal is
returned from the database, one gets the following json:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">{
  &quot;animal_id&quot;: 2675,
  &quot;frequency&quot;: 442,
  &quot;nickname&quot;: &quot;Magda&quot;,
  &quot;sex&quot;: &quot;Female&quot;,
  &quot;birthdate&quot;: &quot;2012-05-18 00:00:00&quot;,
  &quot;release_date&quot;: &quot;2012-08-25 00:00:00&quot;,
  &quot;microchip&quot;: &quot;233388&quot;,
  &quot;enclosure_type&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;release_site&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;remarks&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;release_location_N&quot;: 0,
  &quot;release_location_E&quot;: 0,
  &quot;deathdate&quot;: &quot;2113-05-10 00:00:00&quot;,
  &quot;cause_of_death&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;species_id&quot;: 1,
  &quot;project_id&quot;: 1,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5&quot;,
  &quot;species&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;mustela lutreola&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;
  },
  &quot;project&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;saaremaa 2012&quot;,
    &quot;abbr&quot;: &quot;s2&quot;,
    &quot;organization_id&quot;: 1,
    &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;2014-01-06T02:47:31.610Z&quot;,
    &quot;updatedAt&quot;: &quot;2014-01-06T02:47:31.610Z&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,
    &quot;organization&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;project lutreola&quot;,
      &quot;abbr&quot;: &quot;pl&quot;,
      &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;2014-01-06T02:44:51.935Z&quot;,
      &quot;updatedAt&quot;: &quot;2014-01-06T02:44:51.935Z&quot;,
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>
This butters my muffin dandily. If the animal is associated with more than one
project, then I can turn “project” into “projects” and dump an array. That’s
about as cute as the Palm Civet I just flayed, boned and chewed.</p>
<p>
Users can be associated with animals, also. I’ll create a “keepers” (or just
“users”) key that holds an array of them. Following Tiit’s comment, however,
one <em>user</em> will most likely be the <em>leader</em>. </p>
<p>
When I hit the url /projects, I get something like the following…</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">{
  &quot;projects&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;saaremaa 2012&quot;,
      &quot;abbr&quot;: &quot;s2&quot;,
      &quot;organization_id&quot;: 1,
      &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;2014-01-06T02:47:31.610Z&quot;,
      &quot;updatedAt&quot;: &quot;2014-01-06T02:47:31.610Z&quot;,
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,
      &quot;organization&quot;: {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;project lutreola&quot;,
        &quot;abbr&quot;: &quot;pl&quot;,
        &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;2014-01-06T02:44:51.935Z&quot;,
        &quot;updatedAt&quot;: &quot;2014-01-06T02:44:51.935Z&quot;,
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;
      },
      &quot;animals&quot;: [ ... ]
    }, ...
  ]
}</code></pre>
<p>
I’ll replace “organization” with “organizations” and shove an array in there,
supplanting the dastardly object or hash or whatever it’s called these days in
the fecund land of javascript naming conventions. I should just call it <em>Tasty
Palm Civet Marrow</em>. So, the array I’ll <strong>shove</strong> in there will be full of
<em>tasty palm civet marrow</em>. </p>
<p>
Organizations will result in a similar layout.</p>
<hr class="thin" />
<p>
Looking and listening back on my realization of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/flavigula/the-fen">The
Fen</a> a few days back, I’d like that
plucked violin to be replaced with an actual instrument. My avid reader may
recall that I mentioned a <em>mandolin</em> was originally intended there.</p>
<p>
I’ll approach Christián or Ryan about it today. There will be a few rules
they’d have to follow, however, in doing the deed. It must be a note by note
rendition, of course, and no flourishes or improvisation is allowed. They’d be
free to choose timbre, though, as long as it complimented (and certainly did
not interfere with) the rhodes part. </p>
<p>
The screechy bit at the end could also call for a maniacal distorted guitar
over the bass and harmonium. I’ll approach Ryan with that one, as I do not
think Christián has an electric with him. In fact, I don’t even know if he has
a guitar with him at all in the foul pit that calls itself Myrtle Beach.</p>
<p>
I shall inquire.</p>
