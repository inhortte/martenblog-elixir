      <p>
Oh, Dresden. The middle of the night cradles me. It arms me. It placates me. What shall I do?</p>
<p>
I am at <em>Mc Donalds</em> at the moment and waiting.</p>
<h3>
WAITING</h3>
<p>
Waiting for the train which will roll me far away to the place I would like to be because sleep pervades every thought. Well, perhaps the <em>vodka</em> does, as well, but I really don’t feel it.</p>
<p>
I met a couple of dudes tonight. I forget their names, which is unfortunate. One was a music lover, as am I. We traded songs for a simple amount of time. Heh. That means two hours or so. He reminds me of Wayne. Wayne - the wayne I destroyed. Did I? Sadly, I believe I did. His autistic brother made me feel it intensely, though he denied it. It went like this:</p>
<p>
Wayne should not rely on other people to give himself his life, to succeed. I have done it myself without anyone’s help. See this design on this <em>fucking</em> shirt? I did it! <strong>I fucking did it!</strong></p>
<p>
Wayne did nothing. He wanted into the <em>IT</em> business because it was a fashionable thing to do. He <em>used</em> you.</p>
<p>
Wayne gave me his homework. We were stoned and drunk. We were listening to the <strong>MIX</strong> I had made for <em>Brynn</em>, which included Porcupine Tree and Stolen Babies, among others. That was one of the best nights of my life. I still have the scraps of paper on which I made Wayne write <em>Haiku</em>. Well, I did, too.</p>
<p>
We were friends then, but we are not now.</p>
<p>
Who knows where he is.</p>
<p>
He gave me his homework to do for him. I was insistent that he’d do it in <em>Haskell</em>, but <em>Java</em> was his professor’s thought. I wish I’d know <em>Clojure</em> then, for I’d have tried to teach it to him in that moment. Of course, it’d have been impossible because of the immense amount of alcohol which pervaded the evening.</p>
<p>
So, as the week progressed, I binged. Yeah, I <em>binged</em>. So Wayne’s homework was never done. I sat in the Thai place on that <em>fucking</em> street I cannot remember the name of. I regurgitated my knowledge of functional programming onto this laptop on which I am typing. None of it was about <em>Wayne</em>. I’d left his homework at <em>Cranbrook</em>.</p>
<p>
Now, that homework sits in a box in <em>Seminole, Texas</em>.</p>
<p>
I wasn’t aware, as most people aren’t when recovering from a fabulous binge, that what I had not done had destroyed a person’s journey into the world.</p>
<p>
Nick <em>(Wayne’s brother)</em> told me that he thought Wayne shouldn’t blame me. I’m not sure who I blame now. I sit in <em>McDonalds</em> in Dresden thinking about it.</p>
<p>
I believe it affected someone.</p>
