    This morning, I was supine and reading various Gemini feeds. I cannot seem to find the one I want to refer to with this entry, however, as the space is still slightly disorganised. Probably I took sloum's Spacewalk page as a starting point, found an article about Gemini feeds that inspired me to update my own Spacewalk instance, got up, sat at Tahr (the mighty desktop!) and simply could not find said article again. That sent me on a quest. The quest has been a failure, but I did find another fault in my own...

    As the days creep towards the arbitrary division between one year and the next, I am somewhat culturally forced to think about a few things that I could pay more attention to in the upcoming cycle around our waning sun. I feel like I have grown apart from the "random", or what I call in my personal shibboleth, and in the shibboleth that some close friend share, _Sweet Entropy_. When aleatory ideas blow by on the breeze, I must catch them far more often than I do.

    And December progresses. Blather is transcribed directly from neural circuitry to VIM. Tea steeped. I fetched it and imbibed it. All this is part of another morning in Logroño. Mornings in Logroño are, by now, a routine, or each morning routine is chosen from a selection of those I have at hand. The only consistent facet in the selection of routines is the tea. All praise Tea.

Most importantly, _writing_, which is part of a number of the aforementioned routines, gives me a sensation of accomplishment. Othe...

    Of course, the tea has steeped and has been ready for consumption for some minutes now. To be completely honest, I've already consumed two cups. In contrast to yesterday (or yesteryear, for those of you in the throes of severe time dilation from marijuana or other assorted psychedelics), I'll be drinking _English Breakfast_ today. It's wondrous bitter tinge overtakes whichever metaphorical warmth I'm feeling at the moment.

    I recently realised that I didn't have a copy of Peter Hammill's _X My Heart_. I quickly remedied the atrocity and then listened to said album. I find it glorious. It was released around 1998, around a time of great change for me. The song _A Better Time_ was on some compilation or other that I was listening to in those days. Such compilations were one way to discover new music, just as hanging out on Mastodon is today, though slightly less dynamic. The "gap" in my psyche that not having this album produced...

Well, that is an odd way to start a blog entry, isn't it? _Speaking of James -_ has no context. Actually, considering that I do look back over old entries from time to time, given my writing history, it's not a very odd way to start a blog entry at all. So, I'll begin again.

Speaking of James - and possibly drifting into _quejica_ mode - he is wandering more and more often into the sea of marketing. I do understand why, naturally, and don't necessarily blame him, though that doesn't me...

    Today is the first day in a few epochs that I've awoke without a headache, however slight.

Pistachios are culpable. They will be banished.

    I have an empty cup that used to contain tea sitting before me. It was Earl Grey.

The confusion before the word / preposition _before_ is astounding. Before it irks me further, I'll expound, as it was fucking with my development of _Lakife_. In English, _before_ can mean temporally in the immediate past of whatever temporal theme is being discussed. It can also mean _spatially_ immediately to the front. This ambiguity is not amusing to me. It is an abomination. My solution for Lakife is to clarify the diff...

    Speaking of Michael Achenbach, I should attempt to look him up. My first question to him will be _Did you ever get around to making your own music?_ He was the _intuitive_ type, musically, though he studied to be a mechanical or electrical or some other sort of engineer. He'd pick up a stringed instrument and it just made sense to him. Though, admittedly, I did hear him spending long hours practising in his disheveled hovel-room in the Enfield house. _Intuitive_ contrasts with **me**, one who struggles with...
