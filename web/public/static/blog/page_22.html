    I am in *Saaremaa*, but that is not what I am going to write about today. Or perhaps I shall later today, but not now. The initial subject is my parents.

I have probably written about this previously. I am certain the stabs of insecurity and doubt which riddle me out of the blue time and time again each day are residual growing pains. The Christian life brings a boy up to feel guilty if he feels good. I'm struck by how American this actually is. And how the perception thereof is anything but American. Thos...

    Again, at Fort Sockton High School. Javier Hernandez (why do I remember his name?) was talking to his friend (Probably Miguel) about this song. And it was within ear-reach of me. He just said that *Monsters* is a cool song. Or something similar. I had made him a tape of songs I enjoyed. I did curb things on the tape towards *metal*, so this was on it. But is this song metal?

What is metal?

I recall that *26000 Days* by the Moody Blues was on the tape, as well.

This album came a bit late into my conscious...

    Sam and I were sitting in Pizza Hut (in Fort Stockton, Texas, of course -- our mecca). I had taken David's jambox and set it on the window sill. *Spectres* was in the tape deck. This song was playing. He listened intently. Sam was definitely good at that. His comment was that it did not create the mood it was attempting to create well enough. I'll listen to it again now and give my opinion.

Initally, the guitar does, for sure. Loneliness. Solitude.

I believe I typed this into *Eira* approximately a year ago. It was inspired by a paragraph from a novel by *Cormac McCarthy*. His point was that how we perceive the world - our personal beliefs - carve out the substance of existence just as *wind* or *rain*.

    My parents have a tendency to place light switches either exposed and just out of reach, or hidden strangely behind furniture or appliances. My first thought is that it is a result of my father's insistence that work, no matter how unfulfilling and strenuous, should be the priority of everyone's life. So, that old fashioned switch, which must be rotated instead of flipped, is placed just out of reach of the edge of the bed. I must, therefore, **work** to get at it.

I see where the topic eructer is coming from, as, looking back on fashion and music, there is always a few prominent trends which span *the decade*. I posit that there were always multitudes mulling in the background, creating a tapestry on which the big-wigs could lie.

    **Invigoration**.

I need a splash in the face with the frigid water of existence. Probably existentialism, as well. I am surprised that I grew up to be anything interesting psychologically at all. The drab, washed out setting all around me attests to only stagnation and death. From where did I pull my inspiration? Possibly from **pain**. Obsession?
