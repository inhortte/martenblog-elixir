<p>
Were I Shambal, which greatfully I am not, I’d sit in a bare room thinking.
I’ve just started writing and I’ve already lied. The room is not completely
bare. A low table sits off-center. A rumpled, stained, blue-white blanket is
draped over one corner, splaying also about the floor. A dirty cushin or two or
three lie about. Perhaps more are under the blanket.</p>
<p>
I’ve always been amazed at the lengths he goes to to prove his asceticism.
One would think that such a lifestyle properly taken on denied the possibilty
of <em>proving any appearances</em>. The dim fire of ego still burns, I suppose.</p>
<p>
The letter I received yesterday morning contained the quoted words above. I
call it a letter because part of me pines for correspondence. I am definitely
no ascetic. It was a mere note. Two scribbled lines. The break was between
<strong>blue</strong> and <strong>dome</strong>. It was no surprise. Shambal has been babbling on for
weeks about the sky cracking and letting in what he calls <em>fumes</em> from what he
calls <em>the mantle</em>. I’m not convinced at his ravings. No one is.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
Dopamine, my sphincter - the lengths you’ll go to rationalize your actions
would amaze even Natascha.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Before I lay down on my wine-soiled mattress last night and closed my eyes and
drifted into <em>coma</em> state, I wrote my reply to Shambal. I try to keep my
replies cryptic. Sometimes I feel like it is a sort of competition. Who can
out-crypt whom?</p>
<p>
If you are wondering who Natascha is, I’ll elaborate for a few lines before
my morning refill. I always felt deep pain and emptiness when I was around her.
The fact that I’ve not had my refill yet may interfere with proper memories,
however. Still, there was something. A gap, maybe? No, not in my memory, but in
my feelings when she was around. When she was absent - as she always is now - I
drew childish cartoons on one of my four tables with the chalks I kept around.
I had <em>blue</em>, <em>orange</em>, <em>green</em> and <em>white</em>. They are used up now. Maybe that
is why she is never around anymore.</p>
<p>
All of my tabletops are bare of any covering. Sure, tins and metallic cups
litter them, but most of the <em>bark</em> is exposed. All that remains of my cartoons
are strange smudges in combinations of those colours. Now I cannot even
concretely recall what it was I drew. Surely they had something to do with her.
Maybe a caricature of her face or of one of her breasts or the discolouration
on the inside of her right thigh. I fear she will be completely gone when even
the smudges become a wash of nothingness.</p>
<p>
My memory is poor enough as it is.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
The simmering broth in the cauldron exhales the wafting fragrance of your
woman’s bones and hide.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I sent my note off by courier in the morning yesterday.</p>
<p>
This reply came almost immediately. I say immediately because time becomes
transparent when memory has nothing to register. When spots or windows of this
sort occur, I just assume nothing of interest happened.</p>
