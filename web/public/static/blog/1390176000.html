      <p>
I deny ritual outright. I see positive and negative consequences. Firstly, most
ritual denies spontaneity. The compulsion even to have that morning cup of
coffee before anything else after dragging oneself out of a comfy bed deletes
anything residual from dreams. They fade quickly.</p>
<p>
I need again create a dream diary. In the past, it has spawned stories and
poems - even sometimes music. I’ve arranged lines of code in unfamiliar
fashions because of dream piques. </p>
<p>
I’ve returned to a ritual, as I always do when I am with my parents in
Seminole. Today is time to delete it. I mustn’t set specific schedules. If I
feel like writing when I awaken, I can deny myself that first cup of coffee for
even hours as I work on <em>November</em>. Sometimes musical flourishes arrive in
dreams. They can be captured upon awakening with
<a href="http://lilypond.org/">Lilypond</a> easily. </p>
<p>
I do walk in the arid park every day. These walks are never at a specific time,
however, and are geared towards Spanish vocabulary. This semi-routine was
ridden with more creativity in past lives here. I’d pause at random benches
(there are fourteen, methinks) and scribble small epithets about a certain
position of the atmosphere. I, even now, use those as jumping off points for
weirdness.</p>
<p>
I am most concerned when a ritual becomes a habit. <em>Habit</em> implies to me
something done in a similar manner repeatedly but without much thought.
Rituals, though repetative, can be carefully planned each time, though a
template is always the starting point. I’ve written elsewhere that habits
frighten me. The more ingrained they become, the more one is a slave to
unconscious processes.</p>
<p>
Beyond ritual and habit comes stagnation. When I was a child, I was fascinated
by small programs which created virtual robots on the screen of my <strong>Tandy Radio
Shack Hovnisimo Shittypie</strong> that <em>learned</em>. Initally, the robot was placed in
the center of the play area - a bounded arena containing various obstacles. It
set off in a random direction. Each time it collided with an obstacle, it’d
remember its velocity and angle of impact. Then, it bounced off at a random
slant. Again and again it gathered data until it found the easiest circuit
within the arena. <em>The path of least resistance!</em> It no loger had to gather
data because it’d be ensconsed in a routine. A ritual. A habit.</p>
<p>
My parents are like those virtual robots. They have, over years and years
living in my ex-grandmother’s house in Seminole, found their path of least
resistance. Being a bit more complex than a virtual robot, however, their
habits deviate occasionally, but are mostly set in <em>ahem</em> (red ((sand))) stone.
Even though their jobs are in the dim past, weekends are reserved for cleaning
the house. This example strikes me as bizarre - scary.</p>
<p>
Mealtimes are also set. I believe they would be even if my mother did not
suffer from cukrovka.</p>
<p>
Modifying the details of rituals may give them more life, more intellectual
stimulation. I’ve noted before that even tiny variation in lifestyle
invigorates me. John once told me that I gravitate towards change. 
That was in 1995. Yeah, I still do. Ritual is fatty between dendrite and axon. Habit is akin to death (muscle
memory not included). Shave a different species every morning. Don’t just stick
with goats.</p>
