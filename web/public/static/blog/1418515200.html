      <p>
I’d actually rather not talk about continuations and I ask kindly for you to never mention them again in my presence. If you comply with this request, I’ll be delighted and send you a photograph of my friend <a href="http://christianmnewman.com/blog/">Christián</a> being asphyxiated by a wildebeest..</p>
<p>
So let’s jump right in.</p>
<p>
As I was writing on <a href="http://blog.thinklikeamink.org/#/entry/324">1 December</a>, the attractive young woman at <em>Plus Ultra</em> gave me two phone numbers upon my arrival in Logroňo. I contacted <em>Marisa</em> immediately, but left <em>Carmen</em> to go about her life in peace for a time. </p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/blog/20141201/carmen_bob.jpg" alt="Carmen and Bobbus" />
</p>
<p>
The photo above shows <em>Carmen</em> and I having a wild time (well, most likely an absurd and / or silly time) at some café / bar in the center of the city. I contacted her after I broke my <em>relationship</em> off with Marisa. The month was May, I belive, but I may be mistaken. </p>
<p>
I sent a series of scurrilous messages to Marisa, <em>as is my way of pushing someone further from the center of my life</em>, because (I think) I felt we were getting too close and I thought (I think) I was not really attracted to her. As are all things in this universe, it was mostly my fault, as I encouraged kisses and hugs. We probably walked hand in hand even then. Marisa was certainly no stranger to affection, however. One of my first memories of her was when I walked her back to her <em>edificio</em> after one of our <em>lecciones</em> and she insisted that I be proximous with her corporal being. I complied and I believe it was the first night we kissed. I also recall walking away, crossing the vacant rotunda in front of that <em>edificio</em>, and muttering to myself: <em>What the fuck do you think you are doing, Bob?</em></p>
<p>
As the once famous and smelly Steve used to say - to make the long and short of it, after that, I ended up contacting Carmen. A few of our meetings in, I made it a point to relate the story of Marisa to her so things would not go awry. Hanging out with her was all I wanted.</p>
<p>
As evidenced by the photo, we did have a jolly time together. I made stuffed zucchini at her place one time. We had a bottle of wine and she forced me to listen to some far too happy Latin-ish music. She introduced me to her neighbour and we smoked cigarettes together. We often went to <a href="https://www.google.es/maps/place/El+Rinc%C3%B3n+de+Julio/@42.4714464,-2.452167,3a,52.5y,159.83h,80.55t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sOVHErzaapC0E00pWH4j2kw!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4554ccc2b595d3:0xaee9ed306e037eac!6m1!1e1?hl=es">El Rincón de Julio</a>, drank beer, ate pintxos, had pseudo-lessons and laughed often. In a way, I miss her.</p>
<p>
Speaking of <a href="https://www.google.es/maps/place/El+Rinc%C3%B3n+de+Julio/@42.4714464,-2.452167,3a,52.5y,159.83h,80.55t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sOVHErzaapC0E00pWH4j2kw!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4554ccc2b595d3:0xaee9ed306e037eac!6m1!1e1?hl=es">El Rincón de Julio</a>, I have gone there with pretty much everyone I know in this town and with my visitors from otherworldly colonies (Michal and Mirka). I find it exceedingly pleasant and recommend it even to the most crusty or pudgy gonorrhea afflictee out there.</p>
<p>
Carmen left for vacation in Italy sometime during the end of the summer or beginning of the fall. I was back in full swing with Marisa by then, so slowly came the scurrilous messages sent Carmen’s way. It didn’t help that she hinted several times to me via <em>SMS</em> that she wanted something <em>“more”</em>. So she is history. Only this entry exists to remember her. Her ashes are already scattered in the río Ebro. And I don’t feel a thing.</p>
