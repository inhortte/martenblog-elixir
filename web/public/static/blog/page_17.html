    Discussions involving swabbing the anuses of one's in-laws always lead to
constructive conclusions. I've pondered many times in this *journal* and in
many other *tomes* lying about about how my upbringing shaped me. Marred me,
rather. I sometimes think whether I can put a positive spin on my childhood and
how it affected my current personality.

Shambal clutches the blanket around his shoulders with one hand. The other
holds an old, wilted journal open between his legs. The stained blanket falls
all about him. It's his only protection from the chill. His *proper* clothing
has long since rotted in the closet without a door. The resulting nest is a
home for a mouse named *Murida*. She is saved for another story, however.

A part of me considers Shambal a prophet. I despise prophets. A girl in a skirt
so bright that I am blinded whilst trying to scope her legs walks by in
intervals of approximately 13 minutes. Her earrings are also turquoise. They
swing most likely to the beat that pulses through the earbuds above them. She
cannot possibly be trotting to the rhythm, though, as...

mechanism survives and is still in working condition this evening. I mourn the
