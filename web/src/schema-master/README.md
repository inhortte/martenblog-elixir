# Schema UI Framework
Schema is a modular, responsive, front end framework to easily and quickly help you jumpstart your process in building complex interfaces for the web right out the box. It was created by [Dan Malarkey](http://danmalarkey.com) and the [feature[23]](http://feature23.com) team.

## Versioning
I'm new to developing and maintaining software, but I'm going to try my best (I'm sure I'll screw something up) to stick to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Changelog Releases
As of v2 I will be documenting releases much more than I did with version one. [Check out the releases during development](https://github.com/danmalarkey/schema/releases)
